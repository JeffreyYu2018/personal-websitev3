# from introvert to ambivert

As I've gotten older and the structures around me have gradually given me more and more freedom to find my own social groups, I've come to consider a question many consider at some point in their lives. No, it's not the quintessential question this time, this is a different (albeit also important) one.

> Am I an introvert or an extrovert?

Before, I would easily say I was an introvert. It was easy for me to just mind my own business in high school, killing time playing video games or watching YouTube, and just finding peace in being with myself. However, ever since going to HLAB Summer School 2020, a social melting pot of people from all over the world, and forced to be around people 24/7 for two weeks straight, I discovered that my attitudes had changed.

**I actually enjoyed being around people.**

I'm sure some people will think, duh, everyone does. But for me, this was a marked departure from how I had felt months prior, where, while I was happy to experience social contact once in a while, I had never thought I would enjoy being surrounded by a 100% social environment 100% of the time. 

It was bizarre, because while others in the program loathed not having free time and space for themselves, I bathed in the packed scheduling. I regretted time where we had free time to ourselves and where we weren't forced to be together and where everyone kind of left to do their own thing. It was a drastic change from what I had expected from myself at the beginning of the summer school: I enjoyed being around people more than being by myself.

As a result, while my answer to my original question was originally "introvert," I've changed it since then. I now consider myself an ambivert, someone who gets energized with social interactions *sometimes*, but I find the trend behind how I've changed more interesting. I think I've gone from being introverted to becoming someone who realizes the value in being around other people. It took the insanely social environment of the two week summer school to realize this, but I'm glad I did. I think humans fundamentally crave being around other people, and I think the reason why is not only to have someone else understand yourself on a core level, but also to have fun and enjoy life with. I've realized that I can also derive just as much joy from sharing moments with other people as with by myself, if not more. To me, this was a life-changing realization.

# finding time to be social

Only one problem: rare is a program like HLAB that forces you to be around other people 24/7. College is rarely like this,  where most people have at least some free time during each day to themselves, and most study abroad programs are the same. Work and real life is the same – most of the time, you'll be by your lonesome. 

For me, it was too easy to just stay at home while abroad and bathe in time by myself. In fact, I fell into this pit trap while in Beijing at ACC. I got into the habit of depending on the program to make friends and organize events. Sure, I invited people to get lunch after classes each day, but the majority of my time was spent alone in my dorm, studying. I hadn't made an active enough effort to expand my social bubble and meet people that I could have fun with. I got by, sure, and was able to survive. But it was a far stretch to say that I was happy socially.

The thing about being introverted is, everyone needs human contact at some point. After a few days of spending time by myself, I always develop this "itch." I think I've mentioned this before – it's an itch to just *be* with someone else. This much is what I had known; what was new after the summer school, however, was that this itch wasn't something that just needed to be scratched and satiated. No, this itch could be something to be enjoyed. I could go beyond just spending time with someone and actually go out and *have fun and good memories* with someone.

As a result, it became a top priority at ICLP to expand my social circle and avoid the mistakes I had made at ACC. I would make sure to make time outside of classes and studying to meet new people in non-academic environments. I would attend club meetings and events once a day on weekdays; I would be more proactive in organizing social meetings and being the one to **bring people together.** Organizing hikes, trips to new parts of town. These were the things I had regretting missing out on in Beijing and would not miss out in Taipei.

This was the social goal I had for myself in Taiwan, and one that I would take with me for the rest of my life. No longer would I be subject to external forces and the efforts of people outside of my control. No, I would be the one who brought people together, the one who created the social circle I wanted. It was time to adopt these lifelong habits I didn't have in college and take control back of my social life.

# being okay with being alone

Of course, in my idealist state, I knew I wouldn't be able to simulate something socially on the scale of HLAB. People not in programs are busy in real life, and it would be impossible to get work done (even in HLAB we weren't really working) if you are constantly hanging out with other people.

What has changed since HLAB is that I've realized that it's okay to be alone. You don't always have to be out with other people partying and having a great time like you see on social media. In fact, sometimes being with other people comes with a set of consequences.

I remember going to the Raohe night market in Taiwan one night and realizing that I wouldn't have the chance to explore the night market to the extent I wanted to because I was too busy talking to the others and dealing with the concerns of the group.

I remember being so preoccupied with trying to follow everyone around and keeping up the conversations to not be rude that I wasn't able to look at more than one or two of the night market stands, despite being interested in dozens of them. Being social in that case really made the night really bizarre – I felt a distance between our social group and the environment surrounding us, when I really wanted to be at the intersection and could do both.

That's not to say there haven't been times where I've explored an area and wished to be doing it with someone. Trust me, that's happened a lot. However, there are situations where being in a group is a direct obstacles to being able to engage with the environment around you. In these types of places, it's sometimes better just to be alone.

# unexpected joy in being together

Since HLAB Summer School, I've been able to find unexpected joy in the moments I do spend with other people. Why? Because now I believe that it can happen.

Take an innocuous dinner with some fellow Yalies I met in Taipei. I was expecting just a quick meetup, but it turned into a multi-hour long hangout session with genuine laughs, meaningful connections, and good times.

It's kind of new to me, having a good time with people I've never met before on a first interaction. It's something I always associated with long time friends, and didn't realize that extroverts sometimes literally live on this type of positive energy.

Sometimes, it's more important to learn how to bring this optimism to others yourself. I remember another night when I went to the Second Student Activity Center to join some clubs, and all I could think about was how excited I was to have another opportunity to meet some lifelong friends. In the past, I would want to hold back and restrain that energy to not appear too childish, but I've changed since then to embrace my giddy optimism whenever it surfaces.

Zach's an awesome person to be around and is a positive influence by himself, but I think it's easier in general for other people to reflect your mood. It really does wonders when you try to make others laugh and change the mood in a room. That night, I was reminded of that same feeling of unlimited opportunity I had when I was joining clubs at Yale for the first time – a feeling of optimism and hope. Little by little, I've come to realize that there's nothing stopping me from trying to feel that way each and every day. It's this simple mindset switch that has allowed me to achieve something I've never had before: a balance between friendships and alone time.
