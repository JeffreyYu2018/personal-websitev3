In going from planning this blog, I've realized that there was a lot more content I wanted to cover than I expected, so I've decided to break my Tokyo trip down into even more parts: this part (III) will focus on the days following the New Years, part IV will focus on my hangouts with Risa, Jueri, and Roy, along with the end of my week of self-traveling, and part V will focus on my time teaching at Liberal Arts HUT.

## Some much needed rest and relaxation

After a filled day of exploring Asakusa until 3:00 am, the only thing on my mind was getting into my bed and sleeping in. I guess that's one of the perks of not planning ahead – you're totally free to just take a day to sleep and rest whenever you want!

I think something that gets overlooked while traveling is taking time to just stop and rest. When you look at social media you only see the highlights of people's trips – the beautiful views, the stunning historical sites. What you don't see is the miles of walking to get those pictures. In the first three days I had been in Tokyo, I had walked over 11 miles – **each day.** My feet weren't even sore at that point – it was unpleasant to even put a little pressure on any part of my foot. Needless to say, the largest thing I wanted at that moment was just some time to myself, in my room, to give my aching feet a much deserved break. 

Since most stores were closed on New Years Day, I didn't really have an opportunity to go out and shop, so it was the perfect time to take a slow day and catch up on some work I had been neglecting. I slept in (a rare luxury for travelers), I bought souvenirs for my friends and family at a Don Quixote, and I worked on my HUT seminar.

Overall, it was a restful and relaxing day – exactly what the doctor ordered. No regrets.

## Odaiba: the best part of Tokyo and my favorite part of the trip

*P.S. It was at this point that I realized that I should archive all of the things I did in an Instagram story. If you want another perspective of my trip to Tokyo, check out my Instagram linked in the sidebar!*

The next thing to do on my agenda was to check out Odaiba, the hipster, entertainment-filled island in Tokyo bay. I had drafted a list of things to do beforehand, but the day of, I decided just to walk around to what looked neat. Little did I know that Odaiba would turn out to be the coolest place I would visit during my entire trip.

Odaiba was easily one of my favorite places throughout the entire trip. There's surprisingly so much to do on the tiny island that it honestly could have even taken two days to explore everything. However, I didn't have that kind of time, so I wasn't able to visit Venus Fort or Palette Town. Those will definitely be the first things to do on my list when I come back this summer! \

In summary: if you're going to Tokyo, put Odaiba on the top of your itinerary.

## Sunshine at Ikebukuro's Sunshine City

It was the last day of my time self-traveling around Tokyo, and I had two stops left on my schedule: Ikebukuro/the Sunshine City, and Shinjuku's infamous Red Light District.

## Shinjuku: The Red Light District and ... Ramen Tour???
