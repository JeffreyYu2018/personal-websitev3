# Feeling the effects of the pandemic

Taiwan has remained an island in a world ravaged by COVID-19 so far, and hopefully for the foreseeable future. I've been endlessly lucky to have chosen to study abroad in a country that has kept the virus under control. While I'm optimistic that Taiwan will be able to keep it under control, it's started to have its effects.

## Business goes on as normal ... except with tourism

After Taiwan banned all foreign nationals to keep out the coronavirus, I was ecstatic. Yes, good for the Taiwanese government for controlling the virus! As the days passed, though, while I was still grateful for that decision, I started to see its side effects on Taiwanese life.

One day I decided to make good on my promise from last week to take a random bus somewhere in Taipei. I decided to go to Ximending, which I heard had a lively night market and cafe scene. 

After doing some homework in a ramen store, something caught my eye. It was a boba candy advertisement. Immediately, I thought about it and realized that I would need to buy some gifts anyway to bring back to people back home, so why not get it now?

I walked and almost immediately, upon seeing her first customer in forever, the shopkeeper immediately began offering me free samples. I was amazed – how was Ximending, one of the hot hubs of Taipei City, not packed at all on an evening? After talking with the shopkeeper, I understood what had happened. The travel ban had started killing the influx of tourists that normally frequented the shop.

It was clear that it was taking its toll. The "buy 2, get 1 free" deal from before had changed to "buy 1, get 1 free" for everything in the store. The boxes of free samples she was handing out were almost completely full. I felt really bad, so I decided to buy a few extra items to help out. 

Even though Taiwan is a relative safe-haven in terms of limiting spread of the virus, if this was how it was affecting small businesses here, I can't imagine the scale to which it is affecting small businesses in other parts of the world. 

## NTU clubs no longer ... for the next two weeks, anyway

I was in for another piece of bad news with the virus. In response to a cluster of cases popping up in Academia Sinica in Nankang (southern Taiwan), a closely-affiliated institution, NTU decided to institute a number of new measures to limit the spread of the virus. Restricting access to the campus to NTU students and faculty only, cancelling a number of events ... and banning all club activities for the next two weeks as a precaution. 

To be blunt, this sucked. Clubs were going to be one of my main outlets for meeting local Taiwanese people, and not being able to do so for the next two weeks would put a huge damper on my social life. That being said, I totally understood where the university was coming from, and I'm optimistic that things will return to normal, and that these two weeks won't turn into four or five weeks.

# Staying proactive

Whew! My second week of classes are over, but luckily I think I managed to get through it. 

Even though ICLP classes are relatively small (capped at 4 people), in any type of group instruction, it's difficult to stay engaged 100% of the time. After all, your teacher can only call on you a quarter of the time, and when the others are simply repeating grammar structures, it's tricky to remember why you're there.

That being said, I pride myself on my relatively long attention span, and I'm usually able to remain engaged throughout the lessons. It's easier in some classes (e.g. Radio Plays) than others (e.g. TOCC group class), but I think overall I'm getting the most I can out of in-person instruction.

## Zoom shenanigans

Just because we're here to learn Mandarin, doesn't mean we can't some fun while we're doing it. I thought with everything going on, with the online class instructions, the rising severity of COVID-19 in other parts of the world, etc. that everyone could use a little harmless laughter. 

That's why when I found out about the Zoom virtual background feature, I knew I had to take advantage of it.

After testing the waters, I started to make it a habit of mine to change my background each day. First it was a nice mansion, then a burning house. Following that, I discovered an even **more** powerful feature: video backgrounds. I moved on to penguin documentaries, and capped off my week with a puppy eating corn on a cob.

It's silly and harmless, but I think it's valuable. Not only did these zoom backgrounds keep classes interesting, but they created something in short supply nowadays: laughter. My teachers and fellow students really appreciated it, and I'm glad I was able to bring some smiles to other people's faces. 

## Taking the initiative

Despite NTU (and also ICLP) events being cancelled, I've been able to keep up a positive attitude and take active measures to preserve my social and exploratory life. 

### Hitting up the locals

I've continued trying to build relations with local NTU students that I was able to meet so far. Last Wednesday, I went to gift shops at NTU with Zach and Sandy, one of the leaders from the NTU Cooking Club. Sandy helped show us around and introduced us to a few new shops that we hadn't known about before.

> ###### Don't worry, Sandy wasn't actually getting crushed ... or was she? O_O

Furthermore, I've met a bunch of people through NTU's tennis club, so I'm planning to hit with them some afternoons during the week. This is because the tennis courts haven't been closed yet.

### Preserving an international community

In addition to the events with NTU students, I've also tried preserving a sense of togetherness with the international students at ICLP. After all, all of our classes have been online for the past two weeks, and it's all too easy to feel isolated from each other. Therefore, I decided to take it upon myself to organize some events that we could all go to during the weekends! This Saturday, I set up a trip to go to Jinmianshan, a hiking trail on the north part of Taipei.

# Efforts paying off

After two weeks of intensive character study, I can happily say that while I'm still nowhere near fluent, I can already start to see my efforts paying off. It's small things, like realizing that I could now read the three Mandarin characters in the title of a bread shop next to my house and understand the meaning.

> ###### *不列德 = buliede, a loanword meant to sound similar to "bread" in English*

It's also things like my habit of going to new cafes and restaurants to study. I've been able to visit some cool places that I wouldn't have before and try some new desserts while getting work done.

While I've been able to reap the benefits of all the changes I've put in, there's also some longer term lessons that I've learned that will help me in my far future.

# Falling in love ... with Taiwan

Maybe it's because the government has done an awesome job controlling the coronavirus, maybe it's because I went to Beijing during the worst part of the year, maybe it's the freedom of speech and the foreigner friendliness, but I'm really starting to enjoy Taiwan and love the city.

From the food culture and the night markets ...

to the Japanese-inspired clean and modern streets ...

how can one not like Taipei? I had my doubts at first – Taipei was relatively small and I had no previous interest in going, but now I'm so happy that I decided to go. I'm really hoping that I get a better chance to explore China in the future and get a similar feeling, but I must say, it is really easy to like Taipei. If I get the chance to come back in the future, either by studying Mandarin abroad again or traveling for fun around the world, I'll definitely take it.

# Finding a new normal

We'll be returning to normal in-person classes at ICLP starting Monday, and I'm very excited to be able to meet some of the other ICLPers. There's been a few changes since we started – only NTU students and faculty will be allowed on campus, my old schedule which I preferred has been changed to a new one, and we'll finally start being held accountable for learning the lessons ahead of time and not having the textbooks next to us. 

That being said, I'm excited to have things returning to some semblance of normal, even if it's only classes. While I don't know how in-person classes will go, I'll be ready for whatever gets thrown my way.
