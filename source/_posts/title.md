# Burning through characters

After my first week of classes, I've come to the realization that ICLP's methodology suits me. I feel like each class tries to drill grammar structures in a much more natural way (discussion) compared to ACC (rote repetition). Furthermore, while I was skeptical of the lack of writing and reading practice, it makes sense now and complements my learning. I know that I'm learning characters successfully with my personal study method, and I don't have to waste time writing characters down in homework assignments or reading long articles.

That being said, contrary to what I had heard, ICLP is just as intensive as ACC. With four lessons a day, each lesson possessing 30-40 vocab a day, I'm charged with learning around 100 to 120 characters per day. Thankfully, I've acclimated to this learning pace very well, so much so that I average learning a character a minute. This means I only need to study an extra two to four hours a day, which is **very** manageable compared to the four to six I had to do in Beijing.

While the first week of voluntary character learning in Taiwan helped somewhat, I think the skills and mindset I gained from ACC was more beneficial. I was able to optimize my learning patterns and handle anything ICLP threw at me. My handle on academics is what has allowed me to fit in all of the other cultural exploration I've been doing.

# Crazy with clubs

Some of the other students at ICLP might think I'm crazy for doing one club a day and only giving myself one free day a week to truly rest. That's six clubs in total, way more than anything I had done at Yale. 

It makes sense. Each club meeting is two or more hours long, and putting that on top of classes, homework, working out, and sleep, it's a pretty tall order. However, for me, joining clubs has been just as important as the intensive language study.

As I've mentioned in previous posts, cultural exploration is what I felt like I was severely missing out on in Beijing, so I made it a priority in Taiwan. Given how much uncertainty is in the air with the coronavirus epidemic, I don't know if I'll have chances in the future to go outside and explore. As a result, I've been trying to live like there's no tomorrow. (which, quite frankly, there could not be one)

With my effective time management, I've packed my schedule full of activities. It's a little neurotic, but it's been very effective in giving me room for doing everything I want to do. I think I've achieved a balance in spontaneity and routine.

## A typical week in Taiwan

### Weekdays

* **7:30 AM:** Wake up
* **7:50 AM:** Get up
* **7:50 AM to 8:20 AM:** Shower and get ready for the day
* **8:20 AM to 9:00 AM:** Breakfast

With my protein quotas in mind, I set out one day in search for a place for Taiwan's famous *danbing*. Within a few minutes, I stumbled upon a place on the way to ICLP's language center 5 minutes away. 

![Menu at the danbing restaurant](/images/taiwan_danbing_restaurant_menu.jpg)

> ###### *There were so many options at this place, all of them which I didn't understand.*

I ended up really liking it, so I decided to make it my de-facto breakfast joint. Even though I had online classes for the next two weeks, I wanted to get into a habit of going there so that the transition to in-person classes in the future would be smooth.

Taiwan food tends to be lauded with sugar, so to avoid messing up my health, I consciously tried to pick healthier options. After a few days of experimentation, I settled on two orders of *sucaidanbing* (vegetable egg crepes), one order of *techang* (sausages for protein â€“ yay!) and one cup of *xiannai* (fresh milk). 

![Vegetable danbing](/images/taiwan_vegetable_danbing.jpg)

> ###### *Yum! Protein-heavy AND healthy!*

It's gotten to the point where I'm such a frequent patron that there's one lady there that knows exactly what I want to order each time. The best part is that I don't have to say any Mandarin to order anymore!

* **9:10 AM to 10:00 AM: TOCC (Talks on Chinese Culture) one-on-one class**

Cui laoshi is nice, although I'm not too much of a fan of the teaching methods. You see, I consider myself to have a great long term memory. I know how to drill characters and remember things from days or weeks ago.

However, as some of my friends know, I am **very** absentminded sometimes and my short term memory is garbage. The class structure doesn't help this fact. You see, the first part of every class is repetition of **super long** long sentences from the text by the teacher. It's really, really hard and I fumble a lot of the time. Thankfully, it's only temporary, as the second part of the class deals with general grammar drills and review, which I like infinitely more.

* **10:10 AM to 11:00 AM: New Radio Plays class**

I absolutely **love** my teacher, Mu laoshi. She is pithy, funny, and has an edge that keeps you engaged throughout the entire discussion. While she sometimes drops words that I don't understand, she's really good at keeping the conversation going. I really like the different tone of this class in particular and how it focuses on more colloquial language that Taiwanese people actually say. I also really like how our conversations move in one continuous direction instead of feeling like a bunch of different random grammar structure practices pieced together. While the readings are really hard compared to those in other classes, this is easily my favorite class.

* **11:10 AM to 12:00 PM: Practical Business Chinese Reader class**

The greatest strength of my teacher, Chen laoshi, is that she is fantastic at speaking a standard accent with simple vocab. She manages to convey thoughts using vocabulary that I almost always know so there's never any miscommunications.

To be honest, though, since this class is easier, has more students (all four), and is structured around drilling grammar structures, it's not hard to get disengaged. However, the practicality of the content in the text and simplicity of the characters make it an essential course I'm glad to be taking.

* **12:00 PM to 1:10 PM: Lunch break**

While I have an hour between classes to grab lunch, my normal breakfast is **huge** so I'm usually not hungry. As a result, I instead just go to my local 7-Eleven and buy a sweet potato to get me to my next meal. 

In the beginning, I was planning to use this time to just chill, but after realizing that I didn't need that much time to chill, I decided to use this time to drill old vocab. To elaborate, I dedicate time each day to review old characters so that I don't forget everything I learn. I abide by Pleco's spaced-repetition method and allow the app's algorithm to select characters for me. My strategy of mentally drawing characters instead of physically writing them saves a lot of time, letting me burn through a hundred characters or more in a half hour or less.

* **1:10 PM to 2:00 PM: TOCC group class**

I'll be direct. This class is kind of boring.

I don't know why; maybe it's because I've already done three classes for the day, maybe it's because of the energies of the other students in the group, maybe it's the teachers style. All I know is that by this point in the day, it's really hard to stay engaged. Usually, when I get to this class, I just try to get through it and look forward to finishing classes for the day.

* **2:30 PM to 3:15 PM: Workout (MWThF)**

After a brief break to change and relax after classes, I'll head to the gym. I picked a private one because while it's more expensive, it's significantly closer (7m vs 17m walk) and less crowded than the NTU gym. (The NTU gym also closed recently because of the coronavirus, so I dodged a bullet) 

![XTron gym](/images/taiwan_xtron.jpg)

> ###### *Get them gainz.*

I'm doing the 5-3-1 workout during my time in Taiwan which has been the perfect fit. It's 1) super fast, allowing me to get in and out of the gym in 45 minutes or less and 2) simple, not forcing me to learn too many new lifts. I expected working out 4 times a week to be exhausting, but it's been surprisingly quite manageable. I think all of the other measures I have in place have kept my life balanced, preventing me from burning out.

*  **3:30 PM to 4:00 PM: Shower, drink protein shake, and relax**

After walking back from the gym, I make my *delicious* protein shake, tossing peanut butter, bananas, milk, and protein powder into a blender. 

![Protein shake](/images/protein_shake.jpg)

> ###### *I'm never going back to plain protein shakes with water and a blender bottle. Yuck!*

It's not a lot of time to chill, and sometimes I go over what I allot myself, but usually I finish on time around 4 and move on to the next part of my day.

* **4:00 PM to 5:30 PM or 6:30 PM: Study in a cafe**

This is the newest measure that differed from my schedule in Beijing. Immediately following my rest time, I leave the apartment to look for a cafe (new if possible) where I can hunker down and study. It's a little expensive to buy something each time, and a little more difficult now that my schedule is less flexible, but overall this lifestyle change has brought more benefits than consequences:

1. It gets me out of the house and prevents that "trapped-in" feeling I had at ACC
2. It gives me a chance to explore new places in Taipei every day

> ###### *2J Cafe, a recommendation by a fellow Yalie.*

Furthermore, I've managed to reduce the cost and time issue by also making this time my dinner. Most places I've encountered so far are willing to let me order an hour and a half into my studies. I do this because I'm usually not hungry when I arrive because of drinking a shake, but I'm more likely to get the rumblies later into the afternoon.

> ###### *Bonus points if you can recognize this cafe I went to. (Hint: I've been there before)*

I was a little conservative my first week with going far away to new places, but now that I have a better sense of my schedule, my plan is to take a random bus from the stop in front of my house and explore different parts of Taipei a few days a week! Doing work this way is really exciting and helps clear my mind.

* **\~6:00 PM to \~10:00 PM: Club meetings**

This is probably the lifestyle change which has brought me the most joy to my study abroad experience. Through clubs, I've been able to meet a ton of NTU Taiwanese students and break from my studying cycle. I've joined the following clubs so far:

**NTU Cook and Taste Club**

![NTU Cook and Taste Club](/images/ntu_cook_and_taste_club.jpg)

It's a very festive time each time I go. Even though I'm useless when it comes to reading instructions, I've learned a couple of new cooking vocab and met some awesome people. 

**NTU Tennis Club**

![NTU Tennis Club](/images/ntu_tennis_club.jpg)

Thanks to being outgoing during my practices, I've gathered three or four hitting partners that I can hit out with on the weekends whenever I feel the itch.

**NTU Tsuyo Teaching Club**

![NTU Tsuyo Teaching Club](/images/ntu_tsuyo_teaching.jpg)

Wow, this club is awesome! The presidents are super kind and even hosted an initiation ceremony for all the new members on Thursday.

I've never been more terrified of playing ice breakers in my life. Not only did I not understand the instructions, but I was deathly afraid of being singled out. There was a whiteboard of all the new members' names on the board, and Zach and mine were the only English ones in a sea of Mandarin. So much for not sticking out.

The games were stressful but fun, and once they were over, I felt a wave of relief flood over me. The last part wasn't as nerve-wracking and was instead pretty cute. It was a ceremony where each person introduced themselves and shared their reasons for joining the club.

![Jeff at the NTU Tsuyo Ceremony](/images/jeff_ntu_tsuyo_ceremony.jpg)

It was very cute, and while I had to leave early, I'm sure I'll make a ton of friends from this club in the future.

**NTU Cycling Club**

![NTU Cycling Club lecture](/images/ntu_cycling_club_lecture.jpg)

The first meeting I attended was a lecture hosted by the club leaders, and I had absolutely no idea what was they were saying. All I know is that as they were flipping through slides filled with traditional characters, they came across one in English and asked us at one point if any of us spoke it. I was the only who raised his hand, and they nodded at me in approval. If only they knew I was the only one who couldn't read every other single slide!

After the lecture, I figured out that while I wouldn't be able to participate in this weekend's biking trip, I would be able to participate in future ones. They added me to the private FB group and set me up for the future. I'm super excited for this club too in the future because it'll take me to other parts of Taipei during the weekends. I can't wait to visit more rural areas and see a different part of the city.

* **9:30 PM to 11:00 PM: Study characters** 

Usually by this time I still have 40 or 80 characters left, but with my studying efficiency I'm able to get them done within an hour and a half.

* **11:00 PM: Sleep**

I know from my previous trips that sleep should be one of my highest priorities, especially because I have such a packed schedule. I **need** to get at least 7.5 hours of sleep (5 REM cycles) a night or I know I'll feel super tired. Even though I want to just surf the web and procrastinate at this point, I force myself to get off my phone and get to bed as planned, before 11:30 PM.

### Weekends

In the past I always hated weekends because they would be filled with what I hated: nothing. However, this time, I made an active effort to fill up my weekends and make the most of my free time.
