With the time before HUT rapidly coming to a close, I was ready to end my last two days before teaching with a bang: hanging out with three of my good friends from HLAB last summer. There's something special about traveling when you're not only 1) spending it with people that you knew before rather than new strangers, but also 2) spending it with locals who know the area in and out. 

## Finding Affinity in Autonomy with Jueri

The first person I hung out with after my solo travel hiatus was Jueri, another SA from the Tokushima-Mugi region. We deliberated for a long time on what to do. I personally am really interested in the unique things that you can only experience inside a host country. I can't understand, for example, why some people would travel thousands of miles to go to a place they already host in their home country. For instance, I think that Americans who fly over the ocean to Japan just to eat at McDonalds every other day are foolhardy. Why get a Big Mac in Tokyo when you can just one at home, instead of, say, a kaiseki meal set? 

Yes, I understand that some travelers get homesick and crave something they're familiar with. Yes, I understand that the food at McDonalds in Japan isn't necessarily the same as the food at McDonalds in the US. Even still, I personally could not entertain the idea of doing something like that, so I had asked Jueri if there was anything I could do in Japan that I couldn't do in the US. Luckily, she had a place in mind.

After meeting her at the Ginza Sony Park subway station, we went to the **Affinity in Autonomy** free tech exhibits, located underground right next to the subway lines.

You can find information about the exhibits on their [webpage](https://www.ginzasonypark.jp/e/program/020/), but they're essentially interactive commentaries on the future role of robots in human society. Each exhibit has its own unique robot that does its own thing. For example, there was a robot on tracked your hand's location, spherical robots that rolled away or to you depending on your movements, and one that imitated the mannerisms of a dog. It was pretty cool and gave me some new insights into how Japan views their relationship with autonomous machines in the future.

After going to the exhibits, Jueri and I spontaneously headed off to a Tokushima-Mugi high schoolers reunion which happened to be taking place at that exact time. It was kind of cute! It was entirely organized by the high schoolers, and I was able to see a couple of the other SAs and Japanese college students from my region. I even saw some of the high schoolers from my House! Unfortunately, after discovering that I was the only CM there (which made sense, since it was never really advertised to the CMs), I realized that it really wasn't the type of place I should have been at. Mostly everyone was speaking in Japanese (which made sense), and despite the efforts of the SAs to make me feel involved, it was a little isolating, so I left early. I needed to pack anyway and move to the AirBnB that HUT had assigned to me.
