# 春节: a respite at last 

While that first week and weekend was overloaded with characters, I at least had a respite to look forward to: the Chinese New Year holiday, or 春节. I didn't know it at the time, but it would also become a turning point in what had been a difficult study abroad experience so far.

After seven days straight of Mandarin, I couldn't wait to have a break. I was ready to sleep and relax, but at the same time, I was ready to go out and explore. Unfortunately, the difficulty of my first week of classes had caused a problem: I hadn't made any friends to explore with. Sure, I had made the active effort of asking people to lunch or a meal, but I didn't feel ready just yet to get a group together and, you know, explore Beijing. In fact, during those first few days of the spring holiday, everyone just kind of shut themselves off in their rooms. I was ready for a break too, but I also wanted to go out and 玩儿一玩儿 with someone.

Thankfully, ACC had come up with a solution. For the spring holiday, we were to celebrate with our host families. In retrospect, I'm really glad we were forced to do this, because it would turn out to be one of the only times I would get an insight into life as a Beijing local.

# Getting by

It was far from perfect, but it was also nearing the end of my first week of classes that I finally began to learn how to study more efficiency. After adopting Pleco and an efficient learning system (review flashcards, self-graded flashcards, and fill-in-the-character flashcards), I had finally managed to increase my learning pace to something more manageable, cutting down my study time to two to four hours instead of four to six.
