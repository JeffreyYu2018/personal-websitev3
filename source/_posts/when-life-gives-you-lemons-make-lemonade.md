# Return to in-person classes

Monday was the first day of in-person classes this semester, and I was surprised to discover that the switch wasn't that tumultuous. The content turned out to be exactly the same, and besides an inability to zone out anymore behind a computer screen, I was able to adjust almost instantly. Small changes, like using the short 10-minute breaks to review material before classes, have also helped a lot.

While many things were largely the same, some things had changed. For one, was nice to eat lunch with people rather than alone in my apartment.

For the three days of classes this week, I would ask the others to grab lunch together, so that none of us had to eat alone. One day, we even had the entire crew come together!

It's a small luxury, but it sure is a huge improvement over online classes last week.

# Happy (deadly?) holidays

This week, we only had three days of classes, since Taiwan would be celebrating the Tomb Sweeping holiday from Thursday to Sunday. As a result, with this on top of a lack of clubs, I had a **ton** of free time on my hands. 

Unlike at ACC, though, where I felt disconnected from the city and from the other students, at ICLP I wanted to make sure to have as much fun and cultural exploration as possible. I'm happy to say I was able to make good on that promise.

## Staying connected with NTU

Even though clubs were cancelled, and their status of being resumed is up in the air, I wanted to still be able to keep in touch with the local students. It was tough, but I was able to hangout with a couple people I had met before.

I really wanted to hang out again with Sandy, who has been one of the nicest and most outgoing students I've met so far, so on Monday, she was kind enough to invite us to go rock climbing! Both of her foreigner friends had bailed on her last minute, but luckily Zach and I were free, so we went together.

To say it was exhausting would be an understatement. My hands were raw and cuffed from holding onto the rocks, and I was sweating all over. My respect for rock climbers has quadrupled, and I now understand why it is an official Olympic sport. It is **HARD.** I wasn't even able to fully get across the children's wall – and trust me, I tried. Multiple times. I couldn't imagine doing a more difficult course.

That being said, it was a fun challenge, and I'm now really interested in picking it up as a hobby. Not only is it a great way to get out of the house, but its also amazing exercise for my grip strength, which will help me with lifting heavier weights in the gym in the future. Huge props to Sandy for helping organize this! She's been so awesome that I gave her a small bag of Trader Joes foods from America as a gift. She has helped introduce us to so many cool things about Taiwan – had COVID-19 not happened, she was even going to invite us to her house to celebrate the holiday! I'm really glad to have met her and I can't wait to do more stuff over the semester.

In addition to rock climbing, I was also able to play tennis with some of the people I had met before. In addition to hitting with William, another ICLPer, I was able to find two new hitting partners closer to my skill level! Hitting is always fun, no matter where you're at, and Taiwan was no exception. Hitting with locals has also had other unexpected benefits: according to Eduard and contrary to what I had learned from the sports center, NTU students were allowed to hit on the red clay tennis courts, as long as we hit during the day. While they were closed during the break, they'll be open again next week. You sure can bet to see me on them – I'm so, so excited to try them out! It's been a dream to play on red clay my entire life, and as soon as it stops raining, I'm gonna go on them.

While it's not ideal, and I would love to hang out with more people, I feel like I'm doing the best with what I have at the moment. Hopefully clubs resume in the future so that I can meet even more locals!
