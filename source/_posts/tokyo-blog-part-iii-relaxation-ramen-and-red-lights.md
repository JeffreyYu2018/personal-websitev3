In going from planning this blog, I've realized that there was a lot more content I wanted to cover than I expected, so I've decided to break my Tokyo trip down into even more parts: this part (III) will focus on the days following the New Years, part IV will focus on my hangouts with Risa, Jueri, and Roy, along with the end of my week of self-traveling, and part V will focus on my time teaching at Liberal Arts HUT.

## Some much needed rest and relaxation

After a filled day of exploring Asakusa until 3:00 am, the only thing on my mind was getting into my bed and sleeping in. I guess that's one of the perks of not planning ahead – you're totally free to just take a day to sleep and rest whenever you want!

I think something that gets overlooked while traveling is taking time to just stop and rest. When you look at social media you only see the highlights of people's trips – the beautiful views, the stunning historical sites. What you don't see is the miles of walking to get those pictures. In the first three days I had been in Tokyo, I had walked over 11 miles – **each day.** My feet weren't even sore at that point – it was unpleasant to even put a little pressure on any part of my foot. Needless to say, the largest thing I wanted at that moment was just some time to myself, in my room, to give my aching feet a much deserved break.

Since most stores were closed on New Years Day, I didn't really have an opportunity to go out and shop, so it was the perfect time to take a slow day and catch up on some work I had been neglecting. I slept in (a rare luxury for travelers), I bought souvenirs for my friends and family at a Don Quixote, and I worked on my HUT seminar.

Overall, it was a restful and relaxing day – exactly what the doctor ordered. No regrets.

## Odaiba: the best part of Tokyo and my favorite part of the trip

*P.S. It was at this point that I realized that I should archive all of the things I did in an Instagram story. If you want another perspective of my trip to Tokyo, check out my Instagram linked in the sidebar!*

The next thing to do on my agenda was to check out Odaiba, the hipster, entertainment-filled island in Tokyo bay. I had drafted a list of things to do beforehand, but the day of, I decided just to walk around to what looked neat. Little did I know that Odaiba would turn out to be the coolest place I would visit during my entire trip.

Odaiba was easily one of my favorite places throughout the entire trip. There's surprisingly so much to do on the tiny island that it honestly could have even taken two days to explore everything. However, I didn't have that kind of time, so I wasn't able to visit Venus Fort or Palette Town. Those will definitely be the first things to do on my list when I come back this summer!\
\
In summary: if you're going to Tokyo, put Odaiba on the top of your itinerary.

## Sunshine at Ikebukuro's Sunshine City

It was the last day of my time self-traveling around Tokyo, and I had two stops left on my schedule: Ikebukuro/the Sunshine City, and Shinjuku's infamous Red Light District. I decided that I would split my day into two parts: the first half would be in Ikebukuro by myself, self-exploring, and the second half would be another free walking tour in Shinjuku's infamous red light district. And for extra sketchiness, I decided to do the walking tour at night. But before immersing myself in the sins and darkness of human nature, I would explore something more innocent: the consumerist naivieté of the Sunshine City!

## The Dark Nature of the Red Light District ... and a surprise ramen tour???

Shinjuku's a big place. Known for having the busiest subway station in the world, it's a major economic and cultural center of Tokyo. There's tons of lights, alleyways, and people, and its basically a navigator and planner's nightmare. As a result, it would only be natural that I wouldn't be able to find my walking tour rendezvous location and miss my walking tour at 5:30 pm. 

I firmly believe that everything happens for a reason though, because as I was stumbling around looking for someone holding up the iconic Tokyo Localized sign, I mistook someone as the walking tour guide. In reality, he was a tour guide for an entirely different company, AirBnB, with an entirely different focus: ramen! I was intrigued, and in the light of the tour guide who I'm pretty sure didn't show up, I was able to spontaneously hop onto their tour. So I suppose that when life gives you lemons, make ... ramen?

![The first bowl of ramen I had on the tour](/images/ramen_tour_ramen.jpg)

During the innocuous trip I happened to talk to a lovely family of three who were traveling in Tokyo today for their vacation. The father was nice, and as we were talking, we somehow stumbled upon our mutual interest in computer science. Upon further discussion, it turns out that the guy was a Stanford Masters of Computer Science student who was the CTO of Afterpay Touch, a multi-billionaire dollar company in Australia! **What????** Not only that, but he was once asked to be one of the founding members of Google itself. Needless to say, I played it off cool, but I was shook.

*P.S. Yes, he totally ghosted me on LinkedIn.* ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I had to leave the ramen tour early since I had discovered that another free walking tour of Shinjuku's Red Light district would be happening at 8:30 pm, so I bid the group farewell and trekked off again by myself to the rendezvous point. To my surprise, I found the guide this time, and went on a really insightful tour of one of Shinjuku's most infamous neighborhoods: the Red Light district.

It was a really insightful tour into one of the most thriving industries in Japan. My tour guide was hilarious, and it turned out to be another one of the major highlights of my trip.

I think it's really important that us foreigners know to not judge these cultural phenomenons out of context, but rather, learn to be nonjudgemental of the cultural differences between the West and the East. After asking a lot of my Japanese friends for their thoughts about the host and hostess industry, I got the impression that, like for many controversial topics, opinions were mixed. While some viewed the industry as veiled prostitution, others viewed it as a non-sketchy business with mutual voluntary consent. It's a fascinating topic that I'm curious to learn more about in the future, as it really pointed out some of the natural biases I have as someone who was raised in the West. 

That concludes my self travels. Next on the agenda: some meetups with some old friends of mine. But for now, some rest. See you tomorrow!
