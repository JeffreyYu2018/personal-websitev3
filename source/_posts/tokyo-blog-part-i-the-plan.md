In this blog post I’ll cover my motivations for traveling to Tokyo. In my next post (part II) I’ll talk about the things I did during the trip itself.

## **Preface**

The fall of my sophomore year, I was confronted with a question that everyone faces at some point during their college years – **what in the world am I going to do over my breaks?** Being the type of person to plan everything down to the nitty-gritty, I’ve been working on embracing spontaneity. Still, old habits die hard, and this problem nagged at the back of my mind all semester. The scarcity of my time in college is something I’ve always kept in mind in making the best use of my time.

My last resort? Going back home in upstate NY. Yes really. It baffles me sometimes why other students love going back home. Now, don’t get me wrong. I love my parents, I think my Dad’s *pai gu* (Chinese-style pork short ribs) even knocks the socks off of any Chinese food Yale can produce. The *real* problem is that my hometown lacks things to do, and even more importantly, *people* to do them with.

**A Brief History Lesson**

I come from a small town in upstate New York named Endicott. While my parents were born and raised in Zhejiang Province, mainland China, I was born and raised in the middle of rural America. Endicott (as part of the Binghamton metropolitan area) actually has some interesting historical fact points – it was the birthplace of IBM, the birthplace of the carousel, and the birthplace of the chicken spedie sandwich. It was once a thriving center of commerce, with 10,000 IBMers bringing their skills and business to the city. This was the Endicott that my parents lived in when they first arrived.

However, like many other towns along the “Rust Belt,” history was not too kind to it. Manufacturing gradually left the town, with IBM changing its headquarters to Armonk, New York multiple decades ago. With their relocation came the departure of thousands of jobs in Endicott, and consequently, thousands of IBMers. The economy didn’t plunge, but rather, went into a slow but steady decline that continues to this day. Endicott is now just like one of hundreds of cities along the northeast Rust Belt – decaying and gradually fading away.

With the departure of jobs came another effect – the departure of young, talented people from Endicott to support the economy. This “brain drain” had effects throughout my time in the public school system. People couldn’t wait to get out of “Empty”cott, people had to travel to other towns to attend cool “young people” events like J. Cole concerts or festivals. Long story short: there’s nothing really to do in my hometown for people like me.

*Disclaimer:* my county is *very well* aware of this problem and they’ve taken steps to combat it. Measures include an “I love Broome County” ad campaign, along with programs to highlight economic opportunities in the county. That being said, I’m sad to say that I can’t see Endicott ever getting back to its hometown.

**What to Do Then?**

*What am I going to do for winter break?* I already had fall break planned (5 days to catch up on work, what a dream) and Thanksgiving break planned (a trip to Boston to celebrate with my brother, his wife, and my \*kawaii\* niece) (yes, that word usage was intentional)

However, winter break wouldn’t be something I could just organize with one trip. Not only was it longer than fall break and winter break combined, but I had already exhausted some of my options – going to Boston, coming back home. Luckily, the heavens opened and I discovered a pilot program that was perfect for what I was looking for: Liberal Arts HUT, hosted by HLAB.

**The Magic of HLAB**

HLAB is a nonprofit educational group dedicated to promoting the liberal arts in Japan. They host events throughout the year, but they’re best known for their two-week summer school, where they hire university students from all over the world to teach self-created seminars to Japanese high school students. That’s the gist of what they do, and you can find more information about them on their [official website.](https://teach.h-lab.co/why-hlab.html)

I did HLAB last summer, and **it was one of the most life-changing experiences of my life.**I literally could not recommend doing it enough to all my friends. As a result, when I heard that they had a new pilot program over winter break, I jumped on it immediately. Not only was this program another chance to go back to Japan and teach, but it was also **completely financially covered.**Yes, flight, housing, even wifi! I applied to Liberal Arts HUT and was lucky to be accepted. It was essentially a one-week demo version of the two week summer school, so it was easy to prepare for.

**The Long-Awaited Plan**

HUT was only one work long, at the end of winter break (January 6 to January 13), so I didn’t have any other choices but to come home for the first part of winter break. However, I thought that since HUT was covering the flight to Japan, I may as well leave a week early and have some time to self-explore Tokyo. It would be way better than just sitting at home and doing nothing. As a result, after spending Christmas with my family in Boston, I departed from Boston Logan airport for my next stop: Tokyo, Narita airport.
