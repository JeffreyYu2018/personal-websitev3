Upon I was walking next to the Drunken Moon Lake at National Taiwan University, when I thought, *wow, what a scenic location to write a blog in.* I mean, just look at this:

![Blogging next to NTU's Drunken Moon Lake](/images/drunken_moon_lake_blogging.jpg)

> ###### *A drunken lake or a dreamy one?*

It's also a nice time to reflect on my time here in Taiwan here so far. It's only been a day, and I feel like I've seen so much of the city. Yet, already I can feel my previous linguistic insecurities popping up again. *Is my Mandarin good enough? Do I sound silly?* It seems silly considering I've already been to ACC in Beijing, but it comes up in all my encounters throughout the day, whether it be buying stuff from 7-11 and talking to the store clerk, or literally asking the person sitting on the bench next to me if I could sit down. (*"wo ke yi zuo zai zhe bian ma?"*) Trust me, I'm glad to be experiencing this, as it means that I'm getting out of my comfort zone. It'll just take some time to get used to. After all, if you get out of your comfort zone enough, then the place that you go to will soon become your new, *expanded* comfort zone. Next steps then: playing at the tennis courts!

That's enough thinking for now. Let's flashback to the actual point of this blog: talking about my trip to Tokyo, part II. I realized after writing my blog for part I that I really should divide part II into an additional two parts: one for my first week of self traveling in Tokyo and one for my experiences with HUT. As a result, I'll talk about my first week of self traveling in this post (part II), and in my next post, I'll talk about my experiences with HUT (part III).

## The Plan: Tokyo edition

One of my favorite things to do while traveling is to explore the area with some local friends, and my trip to Tokyo would be different. Even though I'd been good friends with some people before, I was still nervous. It's that nervousness you get before asking someone to hang out. I still remember spam-texting Airi, Risa, Jueri, Roy, etc. with the same questions racing through my head: *would they want to hang out? had our friendships died out in the months since I hadn't seen them? would I come across as a weirdo?* It seems silly when I write it down on paper, but in the moment it definitely shines through.

Anyway, my fears were unfounded, and my cheery *"guess who's coming to Tokyo????"* opening line seems to have averted any social disasters. I managed to set up times to hangout with four of my friends from HLAB – Airi, Risa, Jueri, and Roy. Everyone else was on vacation with their family, not in Tokyo during the time I was there, or possessive of some other excuse to not see me. I found time to hang out with them during my first half of the trip to Tokyo.

Now, let me set something straight. After buying into this whole "travel mindset" from HLAB last summer, I really started buying into this idea of "self travel." You know, the whole "self-exploration" mindset where you really discover yourself. I even subscribed to the subreddit "self-travel" to learn how to do this phenomenon correctly. My point is, I spent *a lot* of time planning out things to do while in Tokyo, so I'm gonna be covering a lot of content in this post. I'll summarize the good bits though.

## teamLab Planets: an out-of-this-world experience?

I moved locations so I'm not being assaulted by mosquitos as this lake anymore, so I've got some space to write about the first place I visited in Tokyo: teamLab. And yes, I am *very* proud of that pun.

For those of you who don't know, teamLab is a **very famous** interactive art museum. It prides itself on being the only museum like it in the world. And, after visiting, rightfully so. There are similar exhibitionist places in the US, but Japan definitely takes the lead on taking the genre to the extreme.

The first person I decided to meet up with was Airi, who was one of the SA's (Seminar Assistants) in my program. SAs are responsible for supporting Camp Mentors (CMs) like me who created and taught the seminars to the Japanese high schoolers in English. Even though she wasn't my SA in particular, (my SA was Roy, who I also visited during my trip) we had hung out during the program and become good friends, so I was thrilled to find out she had an evening to go to this legendary museum I had kept hearing about.

The place itself is really cool. There's a bunch of different exhibits, each with its own theme and unique factor. Without spoiling anything, there was foamy trampoline-esque walkways, waterfalls, floating bubbles, the type of crazy stuff you'd expect from a world-renowned museum.

It was pretty late at that point, but I wanted to get something to eat, so Airi brought us to a "Yuzu" ramen place near Nakemeguro station close to where I was staying. "Yuzu" stands for lemon, and apparently it's becoming the newest trendy type of ramen to hit Japan. I'm more of an traditionalist ramen pundit myself, but I definitely appreciated the experience.

## Self-Exploration

The next few days in Tokyo, December 30 to January 3, are considered peak New Year times. As a result, since most of my friends were out of the city spending time with their families, I took this time to get in most of the actual solo-travelling I had originally planned. Here are some highlights:

![A table tennis shop in Shibuya](/images/table_tennis_shop.jpg)

> ###### *I was wandering around Shibuya and I stumbled upon this neat table tennis shop. Apparently Victas is one of the most famous table tennis brands in Japan – they even sponsor top players like Koko Niwa, who's beaten other elite athletes like Ma Long! This shop is also apparently renowned for having a table tennis cafe with tables that you can play on with other diners.*

![Zaku Zaku from Takeshita street in Harajuku](/images/zaku_zaku.jpg)

> ###### *An interesting fried, salty cheese dog on a stick. Not the healthiest or proudest thing I've eaten, but it was alright.*

![Barrels of sake at the Asakusa shrine](/images/asakusa_sake_barrels.jpg)

> ###### *Barrels of sake at the Asakusa Temple shrine. If there's one con to self-exploration, it's that asking strangers to take your photo is a little weird and inconvenient.*

![Sushi breakfast at Tsukiji Fish Market](/images/tsukiji_fish_market_breakfast.jpg)

> ###### *A second "breakfast" of sushi at Tsukiji fish market around 8 am. The media isn't kidding when they say that the fish at the market is some of the freshest in the world ... even if it requires a 30-40 minute wait to eat it. To be honest, I was actually panicking halfway through the meal because I couldn't finish it in its delicious goodness and was too full, and I didn't want to send the wrong message to the sushi chef sitting in front of me. I've never regretting breakfast beforehand as much as I did in that moment.* 

![Tsukiji fish market crowds](/images/tsukiji_fish_market_crowd.jpg)

> ###### *The market's staggering amount of people, noise, and lack of space made it feel like a fish-themed rave from the 60s.*

## Ringing in the New Year, over 6000 miles from home

I came to realize after a few days of self-exploration in a foreign land, I would start to feel lonely. It's only natural for humans to seek the comfort of other travelers to enjoy their experiences with. Even with my natural introversion, I could start feeling this itch to speak to someone with, an itch to share my pre-occupied thoughts that I'd been keeping to myself the entire day. At the same time, I didn't want to sit in a cafe talking all day, and I wanted to use as much time as possible to explore the city. Upon further research, I discovered a solution: *free walking tours of Tokyo by Tokyo Localized.* 

![Tokyo Localized logo.](/images/tokyo_localized_logo.png)

Now, these walking tours were not actually "free" upon further research. Their price structure is based on tipping the tour guides, allowing customers to get away with "free" walking tours. However, most people aren't a\*\*holes, so the reality was that almost everyone tipped, some way more than the base rate that a tour guide would normally get. In fact, I did the math, and it turns out that if everyone in the group tipped the minimum recommended amount ($20 USD for two hours), my 12-person group would have collectively given him $240, which amounts to $120 an hour! Not shabby at all for a couple hours' work.

My first walking tour took me to Asakusa, one of the biggest tourist locations in the entire city. Asakusa is famous because of its shrine and also because of Nakamise shopping street. I'm really glad that I had a local discuss the nuance and meaning behind a lot of the cultural artifacts in the area, because they would have otherwise gone way over my head.
