## The chase that never ends: the chase to find your passion

### The Quintessential Question (with a dash of philosophical musing)

It's the quintessential question that everyone asks themselves at one point or another:

> What is the meaning of life?

Philosophers, scientists, leaders, zealots – they all have different answers. I think it's the topic that people increasingly grapple with as they age and they realize that their time here is scarce. As a college student, I'm in no position to lecture others on what's important in life, nor am I in a position to act like some neo-Aristotle cramming my teachings down your throat. No, I can't do any of those things, but what I can do is share my own struggles with trying to find my identity in college. 

I have a saying that I like to tell to myself every once in a while when I feel lost. I think it's tricky, the transition from the structure of youth to the openness of the "real world," as people like to say. It's what university is all about – finding your place in a world where anything is possible. That quote is the following:

> You're defined not by the things people tell you do, but rather, by the things no one told you to do.

It's a cute play on words, but I think it really does reveal a fundamental truth about growing up. As you get older, no one tells you what to do. Sure, your boss tells you to complete an assignment, sure, the IRS comes after you to seize your coveted taxes. But in reality, as a member of society, you're gifted (or cursed) with something staggering in magnitude: freedom. I don't mean freedom in a traditional sense, whether it be freedom of speech, freedom of the press, etc. No, I mean freedom in the sense of **autonomy.**

When you enter university, you realize quite quickly that life is different. **No one is telling you what to do.** Sure, there are graduation requirements, and major requirements, and parental pressure. However, the fundamental reality is that when you first get to university, bouncing up and down on your undersized bunk bed, you're confronted with the terrifying threat: the lack of direction. 

It's a very different change of pace from primary and secondary education, where everything is ferociously rammed down your threat. Classes you're forced to take to graduate, after-school activities that your parents made you do, yada yada yada. Structure gives you piece of mind because it gives you someone to listen to. By having a direction to take, you're never confronted with the quintessential question and are content to just go along, listening to whoever it is tell you what to do.

But, gradually, these barriers fall away, and the requirements that veiled the need to answer the quintessential question disappear until finally, you're confronted with the ugly truth: what are you going to do?

I can't help but think the limits are endless. Tomorrow, I could go to American Samoa, pick up a pack of tools and live on an island for the rest of my life. Or I could head to any cafe within a seven miles radius to eat whatever I want. You have all of these micro-decisions to make, but you also have macro-decisions to make as well. What impact do you want to make on the world? Do you want to become a doctor and save lives? Or do you want to become an engineer who creates the next biggest technological innovation? Or do you want to become a social entrepreneur, a journalist, an academic? **What do you want to do?**

I think a surfeit amount of choice sometimes is just as bad as a lack of it, because quite frankly, it gets overwhelming. Trying to find your direction in a world where anything is possible is vauntingly overwhelming when there are an infinite number of paths to go down. I still don't know what I can do in my own life to "make the most of it." I don't know what I can do that is meaningful both to others and to the beholder. I'm lost. 

I'm not gonna get cheesy here and say the cliché in the room:

> Oh, being lost is okay!

Quite frankly, **it's hard.** It's difficult finding a sense of identity when there's no one to guide you to it. Everyone has a different answer, and finding the one that is the most meaningful to you is one of life's great challenges. Some never each find a clear answer.

### Finding your path

I still remember the structures in high school, where one of my top priorities was just getting into a good university, only to be extinguished the minute I step foot on Yale's campus. It's something I wish I could have known about beforehand in clear terms as I do now. I remember weeks into university I was left with a sense of dread and emptiness: what was I doing? am I going down the right path?

Everyone copes in different ways. Some surround themselves with airtight artificial constructs to give them peace of mind. I have one friend who is so caught up in getting a good job in finance, then getting a PhD, then continuing down the rat race, that his outlook on the years after college have become frightening dismal. Others try to escape from the world and try to avoid answering the quintessential question. I have a friend who plays video games all the time, diverting all his attention to these mini imaginary tasks just so he can have some goal in front of him that he can work towards.

We all cope in different ways, but I think that the healthiest way is to face this reality head on. *You're defined not by the things you do, but rather, by the things that no one told you to do.* Every choice you make fundamentally becomes a part of your identity, and shying away from that fact by deflecting blame on others ("oh, my parents told me to do it!" or "oh, it was a requirement") is only putting hurt on yourself. 

This is why people who have a sense of direction are so charismatic, because they aren't afraid to shy away from this question and provide their own answer. They've set their own goals and are unapologetic about it, so other people gravitate towards them and the path they've paved. They're **leaders** in this sense because they did the hard thing: trying to answer the quintessential question.

This is something I definitely struggled with (and still struggle) with when adjusting to college life and paving myself a path in front of me. And I think, deep down, everyone experiences the same thing at some point. That's why it was so important to me to have an outlet to talk to someone about this and walk through it with someone who was encountering this problem for the first time.

### An opportunity: HUT

This was all happening with the questions I was experiencing in an other post flying through my head. *What am I going to do during break?* Luckily, I had found out about HUT, a liberal arts pilot program offered through HLAB giving past CMs an opportunity to teach Japanese high schoolers about something important to them. What a perfect opportunity!

After applying and being accepted, I had to answer the next order of business: what would I be teaching? Fortunately, I didn't have to pave my own path, as the directors had decided that I would use the same seminar I had used last summer. From my earlier philosophical musings, you now know what I was teaching and the importance of it to me.

### **Motivation, Passion, and Leadership: a three step path to success**

After reviewing everything I had learned in university so far, along with everything I had learned via the public school system, I decided that there was no way that I would teach any of it. None of it really **spoke** to me, and I couldn't find any motivation or reason to teach about something traditional like biology or economics, when students could just take a class on it anywhere online or at university.

No, I wanted to be teaching the things that no one taught. Upon further thought, then, I decided to compile all of the musings that had personal import to me – thoughts about types of motivation, the quotes about passion, lessons about the different types of leadership – and compile them into a three day seminar that represented my philosophy about the world. I wanted my course to provide my own answer to the quintessential question, and to give the high schoolers a framework to help work through their toils and struggles in college.

Yes, I realize that I sound like a cult leader. But I think that unlike religion, which offers a solution to the question via dedication to some higher up deity, my seminar was more focused on giving my students a framework from which to start tackling this question. In other words, I would be giving them the questions and tools to consider in order to help them forge their own paths, rather than provide an outright solution.

My course content, like I mentioned, came from the fringes of where I had picked up knowledge. YouTube videos, leadership summer camps, subreddits like "/r/getMotivated" – plus, driving my motivation for it all, the importance of grappling with the quintessential question. I was really happy and excited to have the opportunity to give an alternative seminar with import for these high schoolers, because it was the type of thing that I myself would have appreciated growing up.

## My time at HLAB HUT

### Karaoke, pancakes, and nonagenarians

*More pictures and fun travel descriptions up ahead!*

After arriving at my AirBnB on the evening of the 4th, I didn't actually begin hanging out with the other camp mentors in earnest until our official HUT kickoff *okonomiyaki* dinner on the evening of the 5th.

> ###### *For those of you who don't know, okonomiyaki is a type of self-made fried pancake, where you put all the batter and ingredients on a hot plate in front of you and cook it yourself. It's kinda like hot pot, except more like hot pancake.*

The first one or two days were mainly just slogging through logistics and preparing for our seminars. This was a pilot, so there wasn't a lot of bureaucratic nonsense that we had to slog through. In fact, I think our HUT leaders did a fantastic job with the program and balancing structure with flexibility, where it didn't feel unstructured enough that it was haphazard, nor did it feel structured enough that it was too inflexible. 

As a result, the other mentors and I had a lot of free time. Thank goodness that the others knew what was fun to do in Tokyo, because I was content to just follow their lead. (you can't forge your own path all the time!) Unlike the summer school, we were given ample time to explore the city and get a chance to have fun before we would begin our packed week of teaching.

> ###### *Dinner at a yakitori place. I succumbed to my neurotic nature slightly and started counting the optimal selection of products we could purchase with our $40 daily meal budget. Halfway through I said screw it and just started buying what tasted good.*

We went to karaoke (see us rocking out to *zenzenzse* from "Your Name" in my Instagram story – **wow** that was the most fun highlight of my entire trip and even the year), checked out some delicious restaurants (fluffy pancakes 11/10), and even got courted by a random 90 year old artist who was setting up his own exhibition! (he also jokingly assumed that Alex and Julie, two of the mentors, were dating, which was absolutely hilarious)

It was a nice way to spend time bonding together before the real reason for our presence, teaching, took priority.
