# baby tweaks to giant changes

Ever since school club events were cancelled, I've started to change things up in order to get out of the rut I've been in. I'm glad I took time last week to write about this, because it's given me the motivation to combat it this week.

Overall, the changes I've implemented have correlated with one of my main philosophies: baby steps to giant strides. Originally, I thought that these minor tweaks wouldn't have any major effects but they've actually completely changed my life in Taiwan. It really is the little things that help, hence, my tweaked version of my philosophy "baby tweaks to giant changes."

# restarting my cafe habit, one day at a time

I think the heavens were on my side, because the weather was absolutely beautiful every single day of this week. After a full week of clouds and rain, we had a full week of sunshine.

Not only did it lift my mood, but it also gave me the freedom to go outside and explore Taipei. One way I took advantage of this this week, for example, was restarting my cafe habit.

Even though I really enjoy being with my international friends at cafes, I've quickly realized that they tend to prefer to go to the same places rather than change it up each day. After trying to bring Will and Meaghan to Ximending, for example, I realized that they weren't as apt to join in my trips to different of the city to find new cafes. As a result, after experiencing a few days of this, I started to crave not only some alone time, but also spontaneity. My routine had gotten stale.

## a mini gem

As a result, on Thursday, I headed to Zhongxiao Dunhua, simply because it was a neighborhood on Google Maps that looked commercial. Once I got there, I set up shop in a cafe I found that I liked.

It was a minor change, but I could feel my psyche restoring. Why? Because I subconsciously knew that I had started living again according to my values. Getting out of my comfort zone and breaking out of routine.

It was liberating to travel and see the cool things in Taipei, like the hip and urban neighborhoods. It's not like Zhongxiao Dunhua is a major tourist hotspot, but it's not like it's any less cool, either. It was such an awesome area, in fact, that at the time of this posts, I'm sitting in a different cafe in Zhongxiao Dunhua just enjoying the vibe.

## some self-exploration

Later in the week, on Friday, I headed out of the house to do some errands. Specifically, I went to a new neighborhood to visit a tennis store called MST. I needed to regrip my rackets, and even though this place was significantly farther than our local shop (30m bus vs 10m bus), my Taiwanese friend Kevin told me that they were well-regarded for their high standards and quality service. They were so good, in fact, that they even strung rackets regularly for pros in the area!

Upon arrival, it was like a mini tennis fan's paradise.

They had a ton of trendy new tennis merchandise that I gawked at, and after only half an hour, I had my set of brand new regripped rackets.

Afterwards, since I was pretty far from my house, I decided to self-explore the area nearby. It was also really cool, and I discovered that the region was a commercial district with tons of vendors, shops, and even temples!

# enjoying the fruits of my rewards

## making the most of what's left

While I was making these little changes, I continued to enjoy the fruits of all the other habits I had developed earlier in the semester.

For example, on Wednesday, I went to an event with my lone remaining club, the Tsuyo teaching club. Since NTU students are currently going through midterms, they hosted a dim sum event to help us get through tests. (I don't have midterms yet but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna take advantage LOL)

Not only did they have dim sum, but I was surprised to discover that they also were giving **handwritten** notes from all five presidents. They had literally made stacks of personalized cards for every single member in the club. (which has *dozens* of people) It was amazing and heartwarming.

## continuing to stay international

I also continued to grab lunch and hang out with my international friend group. I've been able to find some awesome restaurants that I wouldn't have known about thanks to them, and eat some absolutely delicious foods.

In spite of how it's not ideal to hang out with the others every. single. day, I really do enjoy it when we do it on a slightly less regular schedule. Whether it be playing tennis with Will and Meaghan, or grabbing our daily lunches, it's a nice way to stay engaged with the other ICLPers.

## an eventful day

In a nice cap to the week, I woke up at 5:00 am on Saturday to embark on the latest trip I had organized: a double stop day trip to Yangmingshan, a mountain range to the north of Taipei, and Jiufen, a town east of Taipei famous for being the inspiration for Miyazaki's *Spirited Away.*

While Yangmingshan was tall (we had to hike up kilometers of stairs) and the trek was tiring, we were treated to some beautiful views of nature.
