# baby tweaks to giant changes

Ever since school clubs were cancelled, I've started to change things up in order to get out of my rut. I'm glad I took time last week to write about this, because it's given me the focus to combat it this week.

Overall, the changes I've implemented have correlated with one of my main philosophies: baby steps to giant strides. Originally, I thought that these minor tweaks wouldn't have any major effects, but they've actually completely changed my life in Taiwan. It really is the little things that help, hence, my tweaked version of my philosophy: "baby tweaks to giant changes."

# restarting my cafe habit, one day at a time

I think the heavens were on my side, because the weather was absolutely beautiful every single day of this week. After a full week of clouds and rain, we had a full week of sunshine.

Not only did it lift my mood, but it also gave me the freedom to go outside and explore Taipei. One way I took advantage of this this week, for example, was restarting my cafe habit.

Even though I really enjoy being with my international friends at cafes, I've quickly realized that they tend to prefer to go to the same places rather than change it up each day. After trying to bring Will and Meaghan to Ximending, for example, I realized that they weren't as apt to join in my trips to different parts of the city to find new cafes. As a result, after experiencing a few days of this, I started to crave not only some alone time, but also, spontaneity. My routine had gotten stale.

## a mini gem

As a result, on Thursday, I headed to Zhongxiao Dunhua, simply because it was a neighborhood on Google Maps that looked commercial. Once I got there, I set up shop in a cafe I found that I liked.

It was a minor change, but I could feel my psyche restoring. Why? Because I subconsciously knew that I had started living again according to my values. Getting out of my comfort zone and breaking out of routine.

It was liberating to travel and see some cool new things in Taipei, like the hip and urban neighborhoods. It's not like Zhongxiao Dunhua is a major tourist hotspot, but it's not like it's any less cool, either. It was an awesome area, so awesome, in fact, that at the time of this post, I'm sitting in a cafe in the same area just enjoying the vibe.

## some self-exploration

Later in the week, on Friday, I headed out of the house to do some errands. Specifically, I went to a new neighborhood to visit a tennis store called MST. I needed to regrip my rackets, and even though this place was significantly farther than our local shop (30m bus vs 10m bus), my Taiwanese friend Kevin told me that they were well-regarded. They were so good, in fact, that they even strung rackets for pros in the area!

Upon arrival, it was like a mini tennis fan's paradise.

They had a ton of trendy new tennis merch that I gawked at, and after only half an hour, I had my set of brand new regripped rackets.

Afterwards, since I was pretty far from my house, I decided to self-explore the area near MST. It was also really cool, and I discovered that the region was a commercial district with tons of vendors, shops, and even temples!

# enjoying the fruits of my rewards

## making the most of what's left

While I was making these little changes, I continued to enjoy the fruits of all the other habits I had developed earlier in the semester.

For example, on Wednesday, I went to an event with my lone remaining club, the Tsuyo teaching club. Since NTU students are currently going through midterms, they hosted a dim sum event to help us get through tests. (I don't have midterms yet but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna take advantage LOL)

![Dim sum event ](/images/taiwan20_tsuyo_teaching_dim_sum_event.jpg)

Not only did they have dim sum, but I was surprised to discover that the five presidents were also giving everyone **handwritten notes**. They had literally made stacks of personalized cards for the dozens of members in the club. It was amazing and heartwarming.

## continuing to stay international

I also continued to grab lunch and hang out with my international friend group. I've been able to find some awesome restaurants that I wouldn't have known about thanks to them and eat some delicious foods.

In spite of how it's not ideal to hang out with the others every. single. day., I really do enjoy it when we do it on a slightly less regular schedule. Whether it be playing tennis with Will and Meaghan, or grabbing daily lunches, it's a nice way to stay engaged with the other ICLPers.

## an eventful day

In a nice cap to the week, I woke up at 5:00 am on Saturday to embark on the latest trip I had organized: a double stop day trip to Yangmingshan, a mountain range to the north of Taipei, and Jiufen, a town east of Taipei famous for inspiring Miyazaki's *Spirited Away.*

While Yangmingshan was tall (we had to hike up kilometers of stairs) and the trek was tiring, we were treated to some beautiful views.

Our day wasn't over though. After Yangmingshan, we took an hour-long Uber to Jiufen, located on the northeast coast of Taiwan, and were enveloped in some enchanting scenery reminiscent of *Spirited Away.* The resemblance was startling.

I was tired, but it was an incredibly fun day of which I had no regrets.

# taking bigger steps

While doing the things in parts 1 and 2 helped take up some of my time, they weren't enough, as I really wanted to push myself and live life to the best I could. As a result, I decided to make good and finally act on the plan I had made last week: getting more language partners.

I planned to replace every one of the four club activities that I had lost with a new language partner. Not only would this allow me to continue to practice my Mandarin, but it would also allow me to visit new parts of Taipei and make new Taiwanese friends!

I was able to hone the idea after discussing it with one of my current language partners, Eddy (my mom's family friend). 

![Dinner with Eddy](/images/taiwan20_dinner_with_eddy_2.jpg)

While getting a traditional Taiwanese dinner, I had a great, interesting conversation about life at Yale and in Taiwan with him. Afterwards, while telling him about my plan, we recommended two Facebook groups for me to post in where I could find language partners. He said I was a fun and interesting person, so I wouldn't have any problems finding partners.

That being said, I didn't realize how true that statement would be. At the end of the week, I knew I had to act before posting this blog post, which has unofficially become my weekly check in point and deadline. As a result, I posted a message in one of the innocuous Facebook group chats. I didn't expect anything of it â€“ maybe seven or eight messages spread over the course of the day.

Imagine my surprise when not even 10 minutes later, I opened my phone to be confronted with this.

![A flood of Messenger requests to be my language partner](/images/taiwan20_language_partner_requests.png)

In under 10 minutes, my phone was exploding with alerts from Messenger. I had gotten over 20 messages, each from someone interested in setting up a language exchange with me. I was shocked, flattered, and ecstatic all at the same time. This language partner change was working better than planned!

Sure, it wasn't all rosy, and there were some hate messages. For example, after using simplified Chinese every day at ICLP, I had forgotten about the tense relationship between Taiwan and China. I only knew simplified, so I typed my initial request purely in simplified and in English. 

Almost immediately, I started getting requests and comments. While they were overwhelmingly positive (my existing NTU friends, like my teaching club presidents and Sandy, came out to support me), I also got a couple of angry comments asking why I was using simplified.

I didn't really understand why they were toxic, but after asking Sandy, I rapidly understood. A lot of the more progressive NTU students viewed using simplified characters as a symbol of the CCP, so they absolutely detested any usage of it. As a foreigner, I had been artificially blinded to this conflict in the safe learning environment I had been placed in. Sure, I knew about it, but I hadn't experienced it in person up to that point.

Luckily, my friend Sandy came to my rescue and helped me translate my original simplified version to a traditional version within minutes of my initial post. A couple of other NTUers came to my rescue as well in the comment section, explaining how most foreigners learned simplified characters and that it was normal, not a propaganda move by the CCP. Even though it was a small experience, it was a humbling one.

# sorting through the chaos

Again, I want to emphasize that the majority of the responses were super positive, and I was incredibly honored to have so many people interested in exchanging with me. There were over 700 likes, 80 comments, and dozens of requests. While I had cleared up ample space in my schedule, there was no way I could fit everyone in. I still wanted to make sure I made a careful decision, though, so I went through all of the messages, comments, and friend requests and compiled a list of everyone interested. Then, I selected a few who I was really interested in and seemed extra enthusiastic.

Since NTU has midterms this week, most students are going to be busy, which I totally understand. As a result, I decided to take an extra week before starting language exchanging to work my way into full swing. I still have to go through my list and find people who availabilities line up in my schedule. Through these partners, I'm hoping to create a positive social and cultural environment. Furthermore, I'm hoping to create a hub for Mandarin practice where I can try out the grammar structures I learn each day, just like I promised I would do last week.

# at the center of it all: gratefulness

I wouldn't be able to attain all of this positive change without thanking the Taiwanese government for doing a mind-boggling job in controlling this virus. For the first time in months, this week, Taiwan reported no daily cases. Not just once, not just twice, but THREE times! It's incredible, and while I'm going to continue to exercise precautions like mask wearing, it's so nice to have some hope at the end of the tunnel.

![Article reporting no new cases for the third time this week](/images/taiwan20_no_new_cases_third_time.png)

I'm super happy with how things turned out this week. I've been able to rebound, and I'm sure after this week, I'll be back, stronger than ever.
