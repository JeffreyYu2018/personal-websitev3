It's been two weeks since I arrived in Taiwan, and all I can say is that I've gotten what I expected from a study abroad experience: a rollercoaster of emotions.

Sometimes it's kind of hard to believe that behind those pictures you see on social media, the ones where people look like they're in paradise while traveling, is a person who's simultaneously having the best and worst days of his/her trip so far.

There's no point in expecting that every day is going to be a highlight reel, because in doing so you're only setting yourself up for destruction. I think everyone knows this at heart, but when you see pictures of people having fun with their friends on Instagram or Facebook it's easy to forget. It's only natural that you experience the up and downs in life, and I'm glad to have realized that everyone goes through this rollercoaster at some point, even if they only show their positive sides.

Personally, I've already seen the following themes emerge in Taiwan that have made me simultaneously experience extreme highs and extreme lows.

# **Chipping away at the language barrier**

## beijing -> taiwan: a transition more difficult than i thought

It's the center of the entire reason I came to Taiwan on the Light Fellowship: to learn Mandarin and break down the invisible language barrier. 

I knew it was going to be difficult, but I didn't realize just how difficult it would be in Taiwan compared to China. You see, at ACC, I realize that I was in a relatively contained environment. I went to the same classroom each day to talk to the same people who knew my language level, I ate in the same cafeterias where I knew exactly how to order the same food. While I went in expecting to be challenged each day in Beijing by talking to locals, I realize now, after the experience, that I had subconsciously arranged my schedule to avoid these kinds of interactions.

Sure, it's easy to say that Beijing was designed to be like that: structured. But it's those mini failures of talking to people where growth really occurs; if you never place yourself in a position where you're vulnerable and try using your insecure language ability, you'll never grow. As a result, from a high level, I knew that I would want to spend my time in Taiwan pushing the boundaries and placing myself in unfamiliar situations.

Making a goal from such a high-level didn't make it any easier on the ground. I failed many times and experienced several lows where I couldn't do basic tasks in Chinese without the other person resorting to using English. For example, just yesterday I tried to checkout some milk and bananas at my local PXMart, but the counter asked me a question in superfast Mandarin that I hadn't prepared for. After staring at him blankly and him repeating it multiple times, he finally let out the key word: *\[do you have a] **membership**?*

It's moments like these that I realize that I really am far from speaking like a native, or even fluently. How can I even consider interacting with Chinese or Taiwanese people if I can't even go through a checkout without using English? 

The easy thing to do would just break the language pledge and speak English right off the bat, or try to not say  anything at all, or precede my speech with *buhaoyisi, woshiyigeliuxuesheng, suoyiwodezhongyouyidianercha.* (sorry, I'm a study abroad student, so my Chinese is a little poor) Putting these kind of safety nets is just coddling myself and protecting my ego, and it's this type of subconscious defense mechanism that I've actively avoided. I keep reminding myself, *speak up confidently and use my Mandarin!* But putting yourself in positions where you know you'll likely fail or get misunderstood does get disheartening.

## a ray of hope

At the same time, I know that it's putting myself in positions like this that I know that I'll grow as a person. I believe in the idea of baby steps to giant strides, and I've seen glimmers of hope that I soon will be able to handle basic day-to-day interactions without any English, my next goal.

One of my best memories so far is learning basic restaurant vocabulary with a private tutor from NTUE. Since I got to Taiwan a few weeks before classes started, I wanted to get a head start on learning vocabulary so I wouldn't be thrusted into suddenly learning 80+ characters a day on Monday. As a result, with the help of some other Yalies, I set up a week of customized classes where I covered topics like academics and sports. My favorite, topic, however, was the one I did on Thursday: restaurants.

First, I must say the following: **my teacher was awesome.** I wasn't expecting much from this week of lessons â€“ after all, each day's instruction was only two hours long, and I didn't want to prepare more than 60 characters each day. In fact, I wanted each day to just focus on *taolun,* (discussion), which didn't really warrant advanced preparation. While these lessons were to get used to the pace of instruction at ICLP, it was also just to kill time.

However, time and time again, my teacher went above and beyond to make my lessons as engaging as possible. As an example, for this lesson, I was expecting just a discussion on terms or on-the-cuff simulation of ordering food from a restaurant. Instead, imagine my surprise when I saw what qiulaoshi had prepared for me.

She had went out to the local community and gathered **eight** menus from **eight** different food and drink restaurants.   How awesome is that? Not only that, but she had drafted notes and an ordered list of things to tackle during the lesson.

We covered how to answer actual questions that I had struggled with in Taiwan, such as how to indicate that I'm dining in and how to specify my desired ice and sugar concentrations. No longer would I be so scared or hesitant of trying foods because I didn't know what they meant. It was amazing because it was all so immediately relevant and would change my entire relationship with the food scene in Taipei. 

In fact, it would become so immediately relevant that we would actually go to restaurants after the lesson to use our new vocabulary. Now, I've done field trips before, but usually they aren't as personally relevant to me. However, this one was something I had struggled with long while arriving in Taipei, so it turned out to one of the best field trips I've ever had.

I still remember walking up to the bubble tea stand we had found in front of the university and looking at the all-Chinese menu. I looked at it for a solid ten seconds, rehearsing how I would order it in my mind. *woyaomaizhezhongnaicha.* Finally, after the person in front of us had ordered and the server was looking at me quizzically, I stepped in front of the server and said what I had practiced. 

In response, he said rapidly: *tianduwendu?*

It was slightly different from what I had prepared, but I understand what he had said. In what felt like a long and awkward five seconds, I haltingly grunted out a reply. *weitang ... wei ... bing.*

He was quiet for a moment, considering. Then he nodded and made my beverage.

I turned to *qiu laoshi* excitedly. It was exactly as we had practiced, and I had managed to do it without any extra help! On top of that, he had understood what I had said on my first try! 

Following my successful endeavor, I went ahead with my laoshi and purchased the other things we had practiced that day: an entree and a dessert.

It might seem silly now, but for me, this was the first real step where I felt like I had made some concrete progress into integrating with Taiwanese life. So many times beforehand had I looked at a restaurant only to not go inside and try it because I didn't understand the menu written in traditional characters. I'm still far from completely understanding it, but at least now I know the basic type of food I'm ordering (dry noodles, soup noodles, fruit juice, etc.) so I have some control over what I can eat. It was enlightening.

It's these little baby steps that I feel like I'm slowly starting to make progress. This week it might be ordering food from a restaurant, but in a few months it just might become doing essential and complicated services like setting up a bank account. Through slow and steady work, I'm starting to believe that I can finally chip away at the language barrier that had been erected in my life for so long.

Days later, I went to a club meeting with my friend, Zach. We had been popping into clubs to ask what they were like and were about to leave when I found one last one that interested me. I bopped my head in and confidently repeated what I had said ten times that evening to the closest person to me: 

> *buhaoyisi, zheshinayigeshetuan?*

She then proceeded to list off a whole line of gibberish in fast Putonghua that I didn't understand at all, but nodded too. After saying thanks and as I started heading out the door, I heard her say something to a friend that I didn't catch fully.

> .... *dalu ...*

Zach had, though, and he turned to be with a wide grin and said, *"Dude! She just gave you the highest compliment she could give you?"* Confused, I asked him what she had said.

With a big smile, he said, "*she said she thought you must have been from the mainland. \[China]"*

It took me a second but process, but I was shocked. Me, with my three semesters of Mandarin, and I was already having people think that I was a native speaker?

Maybe my goals weren't so far after all.
