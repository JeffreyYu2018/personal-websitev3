It's been two weeks since I arrived in Taiwan, and all I can say is that I've gotten what I expected from a study abroad experience: a rollercoaster of emotions.

Sometimes it's kind of hard to believe that behind those pictures you see on social media, the ones where people look like they're in paradise while traveling, is a person who's simultaneously having the best and worst days of his/her trip so far.

There's no point in expecting that every day is going to be a highlight reel, because in doing so you're only setting yourself up for destruction. I think everyone knows this at heart, but when you see pictures of people having fun with their friends on Instagram or Facebook it's easy to forget. It's only natural that you experience the up and downs in life, and I'm glad to have realized that everyone goes through this rollercoaster at some point, even if they only show their positive sides.

In the section below, I've written down some thoughts on themes of my time in Taiwan that have made me simultaneously experience extreme highs and extreme lows.

# **Chipping away at the language barrier**

## beijing -> taiwan: a transition more difficult than i thought

It's the center of the entire reason I came to Taiwan on the Light Fellowship: to learn Mandarin and break down the invisible language barrier. 

I knew it was going to be difficult, but I didn't realize just how difficult it would be in Taiwan compared to China. You see, at ACC, I realize that I was in a relatively contained environment. I went to the same classroom each day to talk to the same people who knew my language level, I ate in the same cafeterias where I knew exactly how to order the same food. While I went in expecting to be challenged each day in Beijing by talking to locals, I realize now, after the experience, that I had subconsciously arranged my schedule to avoid these kinds of interactions.

Sure, it's easy to say that Beijing was designed to be like that: structured. But it's those mini failures of talking to people where growth really occurs; if you never place yourself in a position where you're vulnerable and try using your insecure language ability, you'll never grow. As a result, from a high level, I knew that I would want to spend my time in Taiwan pushing the boundaries and placing myself in unfamiliar situations.

Making a goal from such a high-level didn't make it any easier on the ground. I failed many times and experienced several lows where I couldn't do basic tasks in Chinese without the other person resorting to using English. For example, just yesterday I tried to checkout some milk and bananas at my local PXMart, but the counter asked me a question in superfast Mandarin that I hadn't prepared for. After staring at him blankly and him repeating it multiple times, he finally let out the key word: *\[do you have a] **membership**?*

It's moments like these that I realize that I really am far from speaking like a native, or even fluently. How can I even consider interacting with Chinese or Taiwanese people if I can't even go through a checkout without using English? 

The easy thing to do would just break the language pledge and speak English right off the bat, or try to not say  anything at all, or precede my speech with *buhaoyisi, woshiyigeliuxuesheng, suoyiwodezhongyouyidianercha.* (sorry, I'm a study abroad student, so my Chinese is a little poor) Putting these kind of safety nets is just coddling myself and protecting my ego, and it's this type of subconscious defense mechanism that I've actively avoided. I keep reminding myself, *speak up confidently and use my Mandarin!* But putting yourself in positions where you know you'll likely fail or get misunderstood does get disheartening.

## a ray of hope

At the same time, I know that it's putting myself in positions like this that I know that I'll grow as a person. I believe in the idea of baby steps to giant strides, and I've seen glimmers of hope that I soon will be able to handle basic day-to-day interactions without any English, my next goal.

One of my best memories so far is learning basic restaurant vocabulary with a private tutor from NTUE. Since I got to Taiwan a few weeks before classes started, I wanted to get a head start on learning vocabulary so I wouldn't be thrusted into suddenly learning 80+ characters a day on Monday. As a result, with the help of some other Yalies, I set up a week of customized classes where I covered topics like academics and sports. My favorite, topic, however, was the one I did on Thursday: restaurants.

First, I must say the following: **my teacher was awesome.** I wasn't expecting much from this week of lessons – after all, each day's instruction was only two hours long, and I didn't want to prepare more than 60 characters each day. In fact, I wanted each day to just focus on *taolun,* (discussion), which didn't really warrant advanced preparation. While these lessons were to get used to the pace of instruction at ICLP, it was also just to kill time.

However, time and time again, my teacher went above and beyond to make my lessons as engaging as possible. As an example, for this lesson, I was expecting just a discussion on terms or on-the-cuff simulation of ordering food from a restaurant. Instead, imagine my surprise when I saw what qiulaoshi had prepared for me.

She had went out to the local community and gathered **eight** menus from **eight** different food and drink restaurants.   How awesome is that? Not only that, but she had drafted notes and an ordered list of things to tackle during the lesson.

We covered how to answer actual questions that I had struggled with in Taiwan, such as how to indicate that I'm dining in and how to specify my desired ice and sugar concentrations. No longer would I be so scared or hesitant of trying foods because I didn't know what they meant. It was amazing because it was all so immediately relevant and would change my entire relationship with the food scene in Taipei. 

In fact, it would become so immediately relevant that we would actually go to restaurants after the lesson to use our new vocabulary. Now, I've done field trips before, but usually they aren't as personally relevant to me. However, this one was something I had struggled with long while arriving in Taipei, so it turned out to one of the best field trips I've ever had.

I still remember walking up to the bubble tea stand we had found in front of the university and looking at the all-Chinese menu. I looked at it for a solid ten seconds, rehearsing how I would order it in my mind. *woyaomaizhezhongnaicha.* Finally, after the person in front of us had ordered and the server was looking at me quizzically, I stepped in front of the server and said what I had practiced. 

In response, he said rapidly: *tianduwendu?*

It was slightly different from what I had prepared, but I understand what he had said. In what felt like a long and awkward five seconds, I haltingly grunted out a reply. *weitang ... wei ... bing.*

He was quiet for a moment, considering. Then he nodded and made my beverage.

I turned to *qiu laoshi* excitedly. It was exactly as we had practiced, and I had managed to do it without any extra help! On top of that, he had understood what I had said on my first try! 

Following my successful endeavor, I went ahead with my laoshi and purchased the other things we had practiced that day: an entree and a dessert.

> ###### *Qiulaoshi and me, post-ordering food. I had ordered an entree, drink, and dessert, and was struggling to hold everything.*

It might seem silly now, but for me, this was the first real step where I felt like I had made some concrete progress into integrating with Taiwanese life. So many times beforehand had I looked at a restaurant only to not go inside and try it because I didn't understand the menu written in traditional characters. I'm still far from completely understanding it, but at least now I know the basic type of food I'm ordering (dry noodles, soup noodles, fruit juice, etc.) so I have some control over what I can eat. It was enlightening.

It's these little baby steps that I feel like I'm slowly starting to make progress. This week it might be ordering food from a restaurant, but in a few months it just might become doing essential and complicated services like setting up a bank account. Through slow and steady work, I'm starting to believe that I can finally chip away at the language barrier that had been erected in my life for so long.

Days later, I went to a club meeting with my friend, Zach. We had been popping into clubs to ask what they were like and were about to leave when I found one last one that interested me. I bopped my head in and confidently repeated what I had said ten times that evening to the closest person to me: 

> *buhaoyisi, zheshinayigeshetuan?*

She then proceeded to list off a whole line of gibberish in fast Putonghua that I didn't understand at all, but nodded too. After saying thanks and as I started heading out the door, I heard her say something to a friend that I didn't catch fully.

> .... *dalu ...*

Zach had, though, and he turned to be with a wide grin and said, *"Dude! She just gave you the highest compliment she could give you?"* Confused, I asked him what she had said.

With a big smile, he said, "*she said she thought you must have been from the mainland. \[China]"*

It took me a second but process, but I was shocked. Me, with my three semesters of Mandarin, and I was already having people think that I was a native speaker?

Maybe my goals weren't so far after all.

# Balancing friendships and alone time

## from introvert to ambivert

As I've gotten older and the structures around me have gradually given me more and more freedom to find my own social groups, I've come to consider a question many consider at some point in their lives. No, it's not the quintessential question this time, this is a different (albeit also important) one.

> Am I an introvert or an extrovert?

Before, I would easily say I was an introvert. It was easy for me to just mind my own business in high school, killing time playing video games or watching YouTube, and just finding peace in being with myself. However, ever since going to HLAB Summer School 2020, a social melting pot of people from all over the world, and forced to be around people 24/7 for two weeks straight, I discovered that my attitudes had changed.

**I actually enjoyed being around people.**

I'm sure some people will think, duh, everyone does. But for me, this was a marked departure from how I had felt months prior, where, while I was happy to experience social contact once in a while, I had never thought I would enjoy being surrounded by a 100% social environment 100% of the time. 

It was bizarre, because while others in the program loathed not having free time and space for themselves, I bathed in the packed scheduling. I regretted time where we had free time to ourselves and where we weren't forced to be together and where everyone kind of left to do their own thing. It was a drastic change from what I had expected from myself at the beginning of the summer school: I enjoyed being around people more than being by myself.

As a result, while my answer to my original question was originally "introvert," I've changed it since then. I now consider myself an ambivert, someone who gets energized with social interactions *sometimes*, but I find the trend behind how I've changed more interesting. I think I've gone from being introverted to becoming someone who realizes the value in being around other people. It took the insanely social environment of the two week summer school to realize this, but I'm glad I did. I think humans fundamentally crave being around other people, and I think the reason why is not only to have someone else understand yourself on a core level, but also to have fun and enjoy life with. I've realized that I can also derive just as much joy from sharing moments with other people as with by myself, if not more. To me, this was a life-changing realization.

## finding time to be social

Only one problem: rare is a program like HLAB that forces you to be around other people 24/7. College is rarely like this,  where most people have at least some free time during each day to themselves, and most study abroad programs are the same. Work and real life is the same – most of the time, you'll be by your lonesome. 

For me, it was too easy to just stay at home while abroad and bathe in time by myself. In fact, I fell into this pit trap while in Beijing at ACC. I got into the habit of depending on the program to make friends and organize events. Sure, I invited people to get lunch after classes each day, but the majority of my time was spent alone in my dorm, studying. I hadn't made an active enough effort to expand my social bubble and meet people that I could have fun with. I got by, sure, and was able to survive. But it was a far stretch to say that I was happy socially.

The thing about being introverted is, everyone needs human contact at some point. After a few days of spending time by myself, I always develop this "itch." I think I've mentioned this before – it's an itch to just *be* with someone else. This much is what I had known; what was new after the summer school, however, was that this itch wasn't something that just needed to be scratched and satiated. No, this itch could be something to be enjoyed. I could go beyond just spending time with someone and actually go out and *have fun and good memories* with someone.

As a result, it became a top priority at ICLP to expand my social circle and avoid the mistakes I had made at ACC. I would make sure to make time outside of classes and studying to meet new people in non-academic environments. I would attend club meetings and events once a day on weekdays; I would be more proactive in organizing social meetings and being the one to **bring people together.** Organizing hikes, trips to new parts of town. These were the things I had regretting missing out on in Beijing and would not miss out in Taipei.

This was the social goal I had for myself in Taiwan, and one that I would take with me for the rest of my life. No longer would I be subject to external forces and the efforts of people outside of my control. No, I would be the one who brought people together, the one who created the social circle I wanted. It was time to adopt these lifelong habits I didn't have in college and take control back of my social life.

## being okay with being alone

Of course, in my idealist state, I knew I wouldn't be able to simulate something socially on the scale of HLAB. People not in programs are busy in real life, and it would be impossible to get work done (even in HLAB we weren't really working) if you are constantly hanging out with other people.

What has changed since HLAB is that I've realized that it's okay to be alone. You don't always have to be out with other people partying and having a great time like you see on social media. In fact, sometimes being with other people comes with a set of consequences.

I remember going to the Raohe night market in Taiwan one night and realizing that I wouldn't have the chance to explore the night market to the extent I wanted to because I was too busy talking to the others and dealing with the concerns of the group.

> ###### *Abigail (a fellow Yalie), a Taiwanese local in our group, and me at the Raohe night market.*

I remember being so preoccupied with trying to follow everyone around and keeping up the conversations to not be rude that I wasn't able to look at more than one or two of the night market stands, despite being interested in dozens of them. Being social in that case really made the night really bizarre – I felt a distance between our social group and the environment surrounding us, when I really wanted to be at the intersection and could do both.

That's not to say there haven't been times where I've explored an area and wished to be doing it with someone. Trust me, that's happened a lot. However, there are situations where being in a group is a direct obstacles to being able to engage with the environment around you. In these types of places, it's sometimes better just to be alone.

## unexpected joy in being together

Since HLAB Summer School, I've been able to find unexpected joy in the moments I do spend with other people. Why? Because now I believe that it can happen.

Take an innocuous dinner with some fellow Yalies I met in Taipei. I was expecting just a quick meetup, but it turned into a multi-hour long hangout session with genuine laughs, meaningful connections, and good times.

> ###### *Jeff with some fellow Yalies in Taipei at Shida night market. Zach and I got into some awesome talks about life after college, anime, working out, and thoughts on Beijing and Taipei.*

It's kind of new to me, having a good time with people I've never met before on a first interaction. It's something I always associated with long time friends, and didn't realize that extroverts sometimes literally live on this type of positive energy.

Sometimes, it's more important to learn how to bring this optimism to others yourself. I remember another night when I went to the Second Student Activity Center to join some clubs, and all I could think about was how excited I was to have another opportunity to meet some lifelong friends. In the past, I would want to hold back and restrain that energy to not appear too childish, but I've changed since then to embrace my giddy optimism whenever it surfaces.

> ###### *Jeff and Zach at Gongguan night market following an awesome evening of club browsing. We both found some clubs that we were interested in, including a Tsuyo teaching organization.*

Zach's an awesome person to be around and is a positive influence by himself, but I think it's easier in general for other people to reflect your mood. It really does wonders when you try to make others laugh and change the mood in a room. That night, I was reminded of that same feeling of unlimited opportunity I had when I was joining clubs at Yale for the first time – a feeling of optimism and hope. Little by little, I've come to realize that there's nothing stopping me from trying to feel that way each and every day. It's this simple mindset switch that has allowed me to achieve something I've never had before: a balance between friendships and alone time.
