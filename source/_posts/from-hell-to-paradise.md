Remember my earlier post called "A wave of a week," where I talked about some of the lows and highs I've experienced so far? Well, those troughs and peaks paled to what transpired this week.

# a soul-crushing start

Contrary to what I was expecting, my week did not get off to the flying start I expected it to. Instead, it started with little inconveniences, like losing my driver's license, and grew into bigger headaches, like learning I wouldn't be able to do my internship in Taiwan. 

Indeed, discovering that I would have to return to America on June 1 in order to complete my (now remote) internship was pretty soul-crushing. I couldn't believe i was leaving from the safe haven that is Taiwan to the chaos that is America. It didn't help that I also had some existential crises coinciding with all of this.

Needless to say, despite my efforts each day to reframe positively, I got into a slump.

# a linguistic distraction 

Thank goodness I was way busier than normal, because otherwise I would have spent all week brooding over having to return home. This week, I met with 4 language partners, who helped me distract me from the chaos that was unfolding.

## banter with belle

On Monday I met with Belle, a senior at NTU majoring in accounting and planning to work at a Big 3 firm.

To be honest, it was a little awkward and forced at first doing normal self-introductions and getting back into meeting new people for the first time in a while. However, it wasn't long before I started throwing in some grammar structures and cracking jokes, and we finally started to warm up to one another. We chatted about cultural differences anywhere from philosophies (of college students) to flirting to slang! I laughed a ton and left with a big smile, the clouds hanging over my head temporarily dissipated. 

## prepping with Yvonne

On Tuesday, the tone changed completely, and I exchanged with Yvonne with a little bit more business-like tone. Another senior at NTU majoring in accounting, she was planning to study in America to get her Master's Degree next year, and as a result, wanted some help with interviewing and learning more about American life.

Of course, it wasn't nearly as serious as a professional language exchange, and I was able to balance helping her with her goals with forwarding my goals: learning more about Taiwanese culture and slang. 

## hitting with Eduard

I have multiple hitting partners but forgot to take pictures with them in the past. Ever since I realized I only have a month left in Taiwan, though, I wanted to make sure that I recorded every moment so that I wouldn't forget about them.

As a result, on Wednesday, when hitting with Eduard, the president of the tennis club, I made sure to snap this picture of us two *shuaige(s).*

Once again, hitting the fluff out of the ball and practicing my neo-two-handed-backhand helped me release some pent-up energy and get me out of my funk. Eduard also seemed to appreciate it, getting a much-needed study break before his upcoming exams.

## learning with Doris

Also on Wednesday, I met with Doris, a sophomore at NTU studying economics. Honestly, it was one of my more awkward exchanges. Our personalities didn't quite mesh, and I felt a little bit unhelpful as she was already really fluent in English.

That being said, I was able to pry some cool slang from our exchange, including stuff like "Liu Liu Liu" which is *kouyu* for *lihai.* Did you guys know that Taiwanese people also count differently with their hands? Their "six" isn't like ours in America, where we just use one thumb. Rather, they outstretch their thumb and pinky, because it apparently it's close to the actual Mandarin character for six. Neat!

# a weekend in paradise

My time crunch really worked in my favor in distracting me, but what I really needed was a major vacation from everything going on. Little did I know it, but the trip I had planned for the weekend would help me do exactly this: a complete 180.

You see, this week was our final presentation week, so we were granted an extra long 3.5 day weekend to recover. One of my friends, Meaghan, organized a trip to Taidong, a city on the other part of the island, and Green Island, a place I had seen in one of the Light Fellow's blogs. I helped them plan a ton of activities and was ready to rebound from a sluggish start of the week.

## a quarter of an airport

The first problem was obvious: how would we get to Taidong from Taipei?

The others had managed to snag train tickets before they sold out, but I wasn't so lucky. The only option left for me to get to Taitung by the end of Thursday was to fly. As a result, after my final speech around 2 pm, I packed and headed to Songshan airport.

It was eerily empty, which was unsettling. It's one thing to hear about how the airline industry is getting crushed by this virus and another thing to see it for yourself. If this was how domestic flights were being affected, I can't image how bad international flights look right now.

That being said, at least it was a beautiful day outside.

My flight was also completely full, which was interesting. It was only 50 minutes though, and everyone had to wear masks, so it wasn't that bad.
