Remember my earlier post called "A wave of a week," where I talked about some of the lows and highs I've experienced so far? Well, those troughs and peaks paled to what transpired this week.

# a soul-crushing start

Contrary to what I was expecting, my week did not get off to the flying start I expected it to. Instead, it started with little inconveniences, like losing my driver's license, and grew into bigger headaches, like learning I wouldn't be able to do my internship in Taiwan. 

Indeed, discovering that I would have to return to America on June 1 in order to complete my (now remote) internship was pretty soul-crushing. I couldn't believe i was leaving from the safe haven that is Taiwan to the chaos that is America. It didn't help that I also had some existential crises coinciding with all of this.

Needless to say, despite my efforts each day to reframe positively, I got into a slump.

# a linguistic distraction

Thank goodness I was way busier than normal, because otherwise I would have spent all week brooding over having to return home. This week, I met with 4 language partners, who helped me distract me from the chaos that was unfolding.

## banter with belle

On Monday I met with Belle, a senior at NTU majoring in accounting and planning to work at a Big 3 firm. 

![Language exchange with Belle](/images/taiwan20_042720_belle.jpg)

To be honest, it was a little awkward and forced at first doing normal self-introductions and getting back into meeting new people for the first time in a while. However, it wasn't long before I started throwing in some grammar structures and cracking jokes, and we finally started to warm up to one another. We chatted about cultural differences anywhere from philosophies (of college students) to flirting to slang! I laughed a ton and left with a big smile, the clouds hanging over my head temporarily dissipated. 

## prepping with Yvonne

On Tuesday, the tone changed completely, and I exchanged with Yvonne with a little bit more business-like tone. Another senior at NTU majoring in accounting, she was planning to study in America to get her Master's Degree next year, and as a result, wanted some help with interviewing and learning more about American life.

Of course, it wasn't nearly as serious as a professional language exchange, and I was able to balance helping her with her goals with forwarding my goals: learning more about Taiwanese culture and slang. 

## hitting with Eduard

I have multiple hitting partners but forgot to take pictures with them in the past. Ever since I realized I only have a month left in Taiwan, though, I wanted to make sure that I recorded every moment so that I wouldn't forget about them.

As a result, on Wednesday, when hitting with Eduard, the president of the tennis club, I made sure to snap this picture of us two *shuaige(s).*

![Tennis with Eduard](/images/taiwan20_042920_eduard.jpg)

Once again, hitting the fluff out of the ball and practicing my neo-two-handed-backhand helped me release some pent-up energy and get me out of my funk. Eduard also seemed to appreciate it, getting a much-needed study break before his upcoming exams.

## learning with Doris

Also on Wednesday, I met with Doris, a sophomore at NTU studying economics. Honestly, it was one of my more awkward exchanges. Our personalities didn't quite mesh, and I felt a little bit unhelpful as she was already really fluent in English. 

![Language exchange with Doris](/images/taiwan20_042920_doris.jpg)

That being said, I was able to pry some cool slang from our exchange, including stuff like "Liu Liu Liu" which is *kouyu* for *lihai.* Did you guys know that Taiwanese people also count differently with their hands? Their "six" isn't like ours in America, where we just use one thumb. Rather, they outstretch their thumb and pinky, because it apparently it's close to the actual Mandarin character for six. Neat!

# a weekend in paradise

My time crunch really worked in my favor in distracting me, but what I really needed was a major vacation from everything going on. Little did I know it, but the trip I had planned for the weekend would help me do exactly this: a complete 180.

You see, this week was our final presentation week, so we were granted an extra long 3.5 day weekend to recover. One of my friends, Meaghan, organized a trip to Taidong, a city on the other part of the island, and Green Island, a place I had seen in one of the Light Fellow's blogs. I helped them plan a ton of activities and was ready to rebound from a sluggish start of the week.

## a quarter of an airport

The first problem was obvious: how would we get to Taidong from Taipei?

The others had managed to snag train tickets before they sold out, but I wasn't so lucky. The only option left for me to get to Taitung by the end of Thursday was to fly. As a result, after my final speech around 2 pm, I packed and headed to Songshan airport.

![A nearly empty Songshan airport](/images/taiwan20_043020_songshan_empty.jpg)

It was eerily empty, which was unsettling. It's one thing to hear about how the airline industry is getting crushed by this virus and another thing to see it for yourself. If this was how domestic flights were being affected, I can't image how bad international flights look right now.

That being said, at least it was a beautiful day outside.

![A beautiful day outside at Songshan](/images/taiwan20_043020_songshan_outside_beautiful.jpg)

My flight was also completely full, which was interesting. It was only 50 minutes though, and everyone had to wear masks, so it wasn't that bad.

## getting to green island

After hanging out for a bit in Taidong, eating some awesome fried chicken ...

![Fried chicken joint](/images/taiwan20_043020_fried_chicken.jpg)

We were ready for the main part of our trip: Green Island! Once again though, how were we supposed to get there? We had two options, by plane or by boat, and we chose the one hour ferry.

![Us at the ferry prior to boarding](/images/taiwan20_050120_green_island_ferry.jpg)

Meg had prepared some anti-nausea medicine courtesy of her teacher, so I was able to fall asleep because I got too sick from the tossing and turning. I woke up just in time though to see Green Island in awe rapidly appearing in the distance. This was only after a 50 minute ferry; I can only imagine what it was like for Columbus to discover North America.

## circling the island, biker gang style

Upon arriving on the island, I was treated to another surprise: the "electric" scooters we were to be given weren't scooters after all: they were motorcycles!

![Jeff motorcycling in a cool poncho](/images/taiwan20_050120_green_island_motorcycling-.jpg)

I was terrified: I didn't have my license, I didn't know if it was legal in Taiwan, I had never ridden a motorcycle before, and I was in a completely foreign location. That being said, after I got settled, I realized it was way easier than I thought. It's just like riding a bike â€“ a really big, motorized bike.

Once I got on, I never looked back. I can't do justice with words to the views I experienced biking across the island. The clouds had cleared almost immediately after we had arrived, and the scenery seemed to come straight out of my traveling dreams. The entire experience: the wind blowing against my face, the waves lapping against the beach, the humming of my bike as I wound around the coast: just wow.

## arriving in the hostel

Not soon after, we arrived in the hostel. I couldn't believe it: it was a brand new house, smack right next to the ocean.

![The interior of the hostel](/images/taiwan20_050120_hostel_interior.jpg)

We could even supposedly see the sunrise right from our hostel room!

![The view from our hostel](/images/taiwan20_050120_green_island_hostel_view.jpg)

The hostel owner was incredibly kind and spoke great English (even though I actively tried to practice my Mandarin with her, haha). Almost immediately, I knew that we were off to a great start to our excursion.

## snorkeling

After we settled into our hostel, we left for our first activity of the day: snorkeling. I normally hate saltwater, after getting sick as a kid from swimming in the ocean, but this time, it was totally worth it.

Not only because of the fun above the water ...

But also for the hidden world underneath it.

![Snorkeling under the water](/images/taiwan20_050120_snorkeling_underwater.jpg)

I was able to give bread to the fish and literally have them eat out of my hand. It was surreal, not only because it was my first time snorkeling, but also because it was exactly as how I had imagined it.

## relaxing off a long day

To finish off our busy Friday, we headed to the hot springs on the island to relax. There were natural ones and artificial ones, and we tried both. Furthermore, As per our hostel owner's advice, we bought some eggs from 7-11 and boiled them inside the hottest one to eat.

![The hot springs](/images/taiwan20_050120_night_hot_springs.jpg)

At one point, since there were too many people causing too much noise, Zach and I navigated across the rocky beach, getting scraped a little bit in the process, in order to meditate on the beach right next to the ocean. Being away from people, seeing the stars in the sky, all while listening to the waves lap against the beach ... what a peaceful time.

## an idyllic start to the day

That was Saturday, and our Sunday would get off to a similarly great start. Our hostel owner had prepared breakfast for us, in American-Taiwanese style. That is, omelettes and fries ... plus two or three mugs of traditional milk tea on the side. 

![Breakfast at our hostel right next to the beach](/images/taiwan20_050220_hostel_breakfast.jpg)

## exploring a hidden secret

Following a picture-perfect breakfast, we went with our tour guide to a hidden part of the island. After navigating some windy roads, we stumbled upon what's referred to as a local gem: Blue Cove.

![Blue Cove](/images/taiwan20_050220_blue_cove_front.jpg)

No wonder, because we had to navigate across two or three rocky beaches in order to find it. But it was worth it.

![Posing at the top of the cove](/images/taiwan20_050220_blue_cove_rock_top.jpg)

After hiking to the top of the cove, I jumped off, marking my first time I had ever went cliff jumping. Whew! What a thrill.

![Snorkeling ](/images/taiwan20_050220_blue_cove_water.jpg)

It was what was on the inside of the cove, though, that was really fascinating.

![Jeff trying to climb onto a rock](/images/taiwan20_050220_blue_cove_interior.jpg)

After my humiliating defeat to the children's rock wall with Sandy and Zach, I knew I had to redeem myself. As a result, once I saw the small, seemingly unclimbable ledge inside, I knew I had a chance.

![Jeff posing on top of the rock](/images/taiwan20_050220_blue_cove_top_of_rock.jpg)

20 minutes of ledge holding later, I shimmied my way to the top, finally regaining my honor.

## a window into aboriginal life

Alas, our single day on Green Island after Blue Cove had come to an end. After a tossing and turning boat ride back, we were back in Taitung, nauseous and exhausted. 

That afternoon, we rested for the most part, but at night, Will and I went to a local marketplace my language partner Sandy recommended.

![Lanterns at the marketplace](/images/taiwan20_050220_taitung_marketplace.jpg)

It was crazy â€“ we barely walked 10 minutes from our hostel and suddenly we were in the middle of a bustling marketplace filled with handmade crafts created by the local indigenous peoples. It was really cool to see all of the tribes mentioned in my TOCC class come to life. We were only there for an hour or two, but I had enough time to get a cute hand-carved elephant for good luck.

## returning home

Finally, after a packed weekend, it was time to return home. And so, on Sunday morning, at 8:00 am, we took the train back to Taipei Main Station.

![Taidong station](/images/taiwan20_050320_train_station.jpg)

In a final gesture of goodwill, the weather gods gave us some great weather and surrounded us with nature's eye-candy on the entire ride back. 

# making the most of my time left

Yes, it really sucks that I can't do my remote internship in Taiwan, and my study abroad experience is going to be cut shorter than I want it to be. That being said, there's still a lot I'm really grateful for. For one, I still have my internship. Two, knowing that my time is limited will only help me appreciate the moments I have abroad even more.

There's also light at the end of the tunnel. In thinking about the fall term, I've come up with a tentative plan that would allow me to come back to Taiwan in the midst of this epidemic.

Even though Taiwan's travel ban currently applies to all foreigners, I looked at it more closely and discovered an exception clause for people with ARCs. For those of you who don't know, ARCs are basically green cards for people in Taiwan and are granted to individuals who stay in Taiwan for extended periods of time (6 months or more) for reasons like marriage, work, or ... study abroad!

I'm not sure if it would be possible for me to get an ARC for the fall semester, and I'll have to check with a couple of sources, but if Yale decides to go online in the fall, I want to take the semester off and return here, where it's safe. If I'm able to get an ARC before I leave, I can rest assured knowing that whatever Yale decides to do in July for classes, I'll have a choice.

Thus, that wraps up my report on this week. Whew, what a time. Only four left â€“ it's time to make them count!
