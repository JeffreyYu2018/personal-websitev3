In going from planning this blog, I've realized that there was a lot more content I wanted to cover than I expected, so I've decided to break my Tokyo trip down into even more parts: this part (III) will focus on the days following the New Years, part IV will focus on my hangouts with Risa, Jueri, and Roy, along with the end of my week of self-traveling, and part V will focus on my time teaching at Liberal Arts HUT.

Coming soon!
