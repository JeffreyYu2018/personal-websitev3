# Two weeks of (voluntary) self-quarantine

The weeks following my abrupt return to the United States passed by in a slow, agonizing crawl. You see, following Trump's travel ban on all foreign nationals returning from China, US citizens were expected to undergo a two week self-quarantine. I had returned to China before this ban was imposed, however, and as a US citizen, I was thankfully never really under the threat of being stuck in China.

I didn't want to endanger others in my community, though, so I made the voluntary decision to stay at home just to be **extra** safe that I hadn't caught it. I was coming from Beijing, which had very few cases and was not considered a hot spot for virus transmission, but I didn't want to risk becoming the reason community spread began in the US. 

## Passing the time

In an ironic twist of the events, the lack of stuff to do in my hometown actually made staying at home more tolerable. All my friends were at university as well and I wasn't allowed to drive since I didn't have car insurance, so I didn't feel as much FOMO as if I had, say been staying in New York. 

That being said, it still **was** really boring, as I had predicted, so I had to find a bunch of work-related and entertainment-related things I could do to get through my quarantine without losing my mind.

### Spending some Time with Thiem

I had arrived back home at an opportune time, however, since the Australian Open tennis championships was going on. The ATP Tour hadn't experience a major load of cases yet, so the worldwide tennis schedule would not be affected for a couple of months. I couldn't have more glad, because I was able to watch the Thieminator (Dominic Thiem) blast his way into his first hardcourt final. (he lost as I expected in 5 sets, but the fact he's progressed so far in the past two years is incredible. He's even World No.3 at the time of this post!)

### Baby Steps, Totoro, Netflix VPNs, and more

Maybe it was the fact that I was inspired by returning from Tokyo, but I wanted to use the time to catch up on some of the mangas and animes that I had been lacking on. I'm new to the genre, but thanks to rocking out to some movie soundtrack music in DPops, I learned just how powerful the stories could become in movies like Your Name and animes like Baby Steps. 

As a result, I spent some of my other time finishing all 435 chapters of Baby Steps, using English translations by a person on Reddit. I also found another use for the VPN I had purchased for China: streaming famous Miyazaki works available on Netflix only in other countries! I can't say I've watched all the essentials, but I can say that I've knocked some major works off my list, including My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service.

### Planning for the future

Of course, while I was trying to pass the time, there was no way I was going to give up my study abroad experience that easily. After a bunch of research on study abroad programs that could still possibly accept me this late into the semester, I stumbled upon the perfect fit: ICLP in Taiwan. Not only were they still accepting applications, but they were Light-sponsored, and I would be able to still receive 3 academic credits for completing the program! After convincing my parents that studying abroad would be a better option than waiting it out in the US (oh, boy, was that an important correct decision), I prepared my application materials in the four days before the deadline on February 3, and was accepted a few weeks later. It looks like that best luck fortune I got in Tokyo a few weeks back was coming true.

### Getting back on track with OnTrack

Another reason I was able to cope with being stuck at home for those two weeks was having some responsibility placed on me. In addition to the ICLP materials, I also had arrived at an opportune time for OnTrack: onboarding the interns that we had just hired. I spent a lot of time writing extensive documentation to acclimate our interns to the OnTrack environment, going through line by line code reviews with them, and continuing to engage in the startup that has given so much to me. 

### Finding some new interests

I don't know how or why, but in my lust to find something to do, I latched upon one of the most important recent topics in American news: the Democratic race. Now, I've never been interested in politics – in fact, I would have so recently as considered myself one of the most apolitical people I knew. It's crazy considering how I go to one of the most politically-charged campuses in the United States, but it just never stuck with me.

Not so much anymore. In my boredom, I started reading some of the leading New York Times articles, and the DNC primary just happened to be up there. I started understanding what the appeal of "horse-race journalism" really was – seeing the Democratic candidates battle it out on the debate stage to get a chance to run for President was, quite frankly, engaging. 

### Staying healthy ... or not so much

Health wasn't the top priority on my mind (that honor went to ICLP) but it was definitely up there. Since I was stuck at home, I didn't have access to a gym, so I played with some home exercises for a while in my room. That eventually didn't work out, so I swapped to something more fun: playing ping pong with my mom in the afternoons. Obviously it wasn't the healthiest form of exercise, but it was better than nothing.

I hadn't really explored restaurants in Binghamton before, and I thought I didn't really have a better time to do so, considering I couldn't drive outside. My poor dad had to drive everywhere to pick up my cravings – I have no idea why my Mom endorsed it. Maybe they felt bad already for me having to leave Beijing so early.*

### Other random events

In addition to everything above that something managed to fill up my days, I found interest in some things I normally didn't watch before. I watched the Super Bowl and saw the 49ers spoil a huge lead. I was proud to watch Parasite win a precedent Oscars Best Picture award. Hooray for Asian representation!

### Racked with uncertainty

In the midst of all of these things to distract my mind, however, underly some constant unanswered questions: what was going to happen to my study abroad situation? There were still so many unanswered questions that I just had to wait for: *would I be able to get credit for ICLP? would Taiwan ban travel to and from the US? would the US or Taiwan get the disease? what time should I fly out to Taiwan?* All of these things nagged at the back of my mind, and I did my best to try to ignore them.

### Reflections

I can't say that my two week quarantine passed by as quickly as I wanted, but I can say that it didn't go as horribly as I expected. Confronted with hours of just nothing, I managed to find things to do that kept my mind off the chaos transpiring in my study abroad situation. I hope that any people reading this while in quarantine right now will know that it really isn't as bad as it might seem, if you make it better.
